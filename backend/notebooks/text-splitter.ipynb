An Empirical Study\\n\\nAnonymous author(s)\\n\\n**Abstract**\\n\\nResearchers from the global North and South have collaborated for decades to conduct cutting-edge interdisciplinary research. The tools they used to manage their research projects remained virtually unchanged until the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak early in 2020. Since then, a lot has changed, including the nature and dynamics of research collaboration. How are researchers and project managers adapting to this change? Survey data, semi-structured interviews, and personal accounts from 102 respondents from 33 countries are used in this empirical study to investigate the impact of the pandemic on research collaboration projects. An independent non-parametric t-test revealed a significant difference in the research collaboration infrastructure and home environment between global North and global South collaborators. The findings have practical implications for people involved in collaborative research projects, funding agencies, project management professionals, and universities interested in pursuing or sustaining North-South research collaboration during the pandemic.\\n\\n**Keywords:** COVID-19 pandemic, Social distancing, New Normal, Global North-South, Project Management, Collaborative research projects, Clusters of Excellence, Online Survey.\\n\\n \\n\\n## 1 Introduction\\n\\nIn collaborative research, a globally distributed, sometimes co-located team of researchers work together to address research questions pertinent to their study. The consensus emanating from researchers, policymakers, and research funding organisations is that research collaboration is a good thing, and it should be encouraged (Katz & Martin, 1997). Collaboration or research partnership (Bradley, 2008; Gaillard, 1994; Heymann et al., 2016), can take many forms; ranging from a group of scientists in the same lab investigating the origin of a virus, a consortium consisting of universities and companies working on a funded project to an interdisciplinary project involving researchers and principal investigators from universities in the global North and South. Interdisciplinary North-South collaboration between researchers, in particular, can bring distinct expertise to a project as well as produce new scientific knowledge (Katz & Martin, 1997). Furthermore, as acknowledged by J. Lee and Haupt (2020), research collaboration benefits not only low-income (Southern) but also high-income (Northern) countries as well.\\n\\nThe main characteristic of North-South research collaboration is that researchers are often geographically dispersed.

Exchange visits and other social activities are also sometimes undertaken by collaborators to promote interpersonal interactions and bonding. Researchers can also use emails, video conferencing, or social media platforms to communicate with their colleagues when the need arises.\\n\\nHowever, since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 on 30 January 2020 to be a public health emergency of international concern, many \\\"normal\\\" research collaboration activities have almost become impossible.

      "|  2 | Africa). The research projects are parts of the Clusters of Excellence research projects funded by the German Excellence Strategy. Cluster members have a long history of interdisciplinary North-South research collaboration. The aim of the Cluster, among other things, is to develop a digital research environment for reconfiguring African Studies (Seesemann,2020). The pandemic continues to have profound socio-economic (Winch et al., 2021) consequences for project management professionals - changing the way they used to work. Like many other collaborative projects, we are also heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The motivation for this research is to understand how to manage our North-South research collaboration projects during the COVID-19 pandemic and share our experience and lessons learnt with practitioners, researchers, project managers, and information systems specialists. Project management uses specific tools and techniques to deliver a valuable product to the people or communities concerned. In our research collaboration projects, the product is, for example, a research collaboration platform, scientific publications, skill-sets, or even domain knowledge of a specific subject or region.\\n\\nTo develop a thorough understanding of project management during the pandemic means that our analysis must help us understand the challenges involved in managing the resources and outputs of the projects. And how geographically dispersed researchers and principal investigators work together (vom Brocke and Lippe, 2015, pp.10, 19). Noting that the chance of face-to-face meetings and knowledge exchanges among researchers might not be possible during the pandemic, we also need to understand the communication technologies and strategy project professionals are using to overcome geographical distance (vom Brocke and Lippe, 2015).\\n\\n### Contribution and research questions\\n\\nMany countries have implemented measures to help reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV2 virus and its OMICRON variant. Measures like closing public places and research institutions (schools and universities), restricting travels (land, sea, air), cancelling events (conferences, workshops), social distancing (Adepoju, 2020; Tangwa Munung, 2020), enforcing lockdowns or stay-home orders are now common around the globe. However, some countries are beginning to lift some of these restrictions because of public pressure (Burki, 2021).\\n\\nAlthough these measures resulted in the cancellation of some research collaboration projects and activities, others continued and adapted to the COVID-19 crisis by embracing collaboration and coordination technologies for remote work (Zaer et al., 2020), and at the same time, new projects started in Europe, the Americas, Africa, the Pacific and ASEAN regions.\\n\\nThe pandemic is not only impacting the way we conduct research locally, between universities nationally and internationally, but it has propelled North-South research collaboration to the forefront of public discourse in both the public and private sectors. Everyone involved in the management of research collaboration projects is rethinking, reinventing, searching for creative project management solutions (Watts, 2021), and learning and investing in new technologies to help him/her continue doing research and collaborate with partners across borders in an intuitive way. Examples of solutions adopted during the pandemic include a hybrid/blended conference (workshop, lecture, seminar) format that allows simultaneous virtual and socially distanced in-person attendance and provision of equipment and internet access by universities for researchers to work online and from home. Furthermore, Zaer et al. (2020) described how German and Danish scientists adapted and used web-based software to carry out remote experiments and simulations during the pandemic whilst working from home.\\n\\nA review of the literature on managing research collaboration during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that many studies emphasised the importance of research collaboration in general (Bian and Lin, 2020; J. Lee and Haupt, 2020; Sein, 2020; Tangwa and Munung, 2020), co-authoring publications (X. Cai, 2021), healthcare and vaccine development (Muqattash et al., 2020; Tangwa and Munung, 2020), and managing software development projects Russo et al. (2021), project management case study (Wahbi et al., 2020), to mention a few. Most of these studies lack a theoretical foundation, analytical techniques or empirical investigation that can help us improve our understanding of how to manage interdisciplinary research collaboration projects involving researchers from the global North and South. Thus, best practices and lessons learnt to support interdisciplinary North-South research collaboration project management during the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking in the literature.\\n\\nNorth-South research collaboration projects are complex entities involving people working in different places.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",
      "|  3 | The authors went on to argue that, in particular, \\\"research has substantial elements of creativity and innovation and predicting the outcome of research (or research project) in full is therefore very difficult\\\". Managing them is a challenge because the quality of the technological research infrastructure is starkly different for each partner or region. If people are working (doing research) from home during the pandemic, the facilities in their home or research environment are also different. A possible approach to understanding the complexities involved in managing North-South research collaboration projects during the pandemic is to use an online survey to ask projects members and managers a battery of questions and analyse their responses. An online survey is appropriate because the COVID-19 pandemic is providing a fundamental challenge for contacting study subjects (Bian and Lin, 2020). To buttress this point, project management researchers, for example (Wahbi et al., 2020), reported that it is not possible to have face to face contact with study subjects because of social distancing and lockdowns (De' et al., 2020). Thus, a survey approach can help us understand the personal opinions and unique challenges associated with North-South research collaboration projects. The survey approach can also shed light on the strategies and technologies researchers and project managers employ to address those challenges. Therefore, this study attempts to answer a series of research questions broadly grouped into the two major sections described below:\\n\\n1. Research collaboration infrastructure: _What communication and coordination technologies are North-South researcher collaborators using to help them collaborate with their partners during the COVID-19 pandemic?_ Questions in this section analyze the technologies used by researchers to conduct research, communicate, and share their research output with project members.\\n\\nThe challenges research collaborators (researchers and project managers) face in using the technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.\\n2. Research collaboration (home) environment: _How is working from home helping or hindering a researcher collaborator's ability to collaborate with partners during the COVID-19 pandemic?_ Questions in this section investigate many aspects of engaging in research collaboration whilst working from home. For example, how working from home affects the mobility of the researchers, the distractions they face, internet connectivity problems, etc.\\n\\nThe two sections and questions are part of an online survey questionnaire targeting global North and South researchers and project managers. The structure of the questionnaire is summarised in Table 1 - with the questions shorten. The full survey structure and questions is available at [https://tinyurl.com/y3rcukkk](https://tinyurl.com/y3rcukkk). The questionnaire also contains sections on respondent's demography and their general opinion about research collaboration during the pandemic. The online survey ran for about 3.5 months (January 15 - April 30, 2021).\\n\\n\\\\nTable 1: Structure of the survey questionnaire \\n\\n## 2 Background and Related Work\\n\\nResearch collaboration projects are exciting to study because of their multidimensional and interdisciplinary nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",
      "|  4 | According to (Sowe et al., 2021), a research collaboration project consists of partners locally situated within a country (e.g. Germany or Nigeria), region (e.g. Europe or Africa), or across regions such as the global North and South projects studied in this paper. Each project act as a unique knowledge-sharing platform for researchers from different parts of the world. Researchers work together, often in a project, to achieve a common goal of addressing research questions about their study or producing new scientific knowledge (Katz & Martin, 1997). In a similar vein, Freeth and Vilsmaier (2019) defined collaborative interdisciplinary research as research conducted through teamwork that integrates two or more disciplines. Some researchers, for example, Heymann et al. (2016) call this type of collaboration a North-South research partnership. Others take a socio-economic dimension and argue that the North-South dichotomy categorises nations as either being rich, developed countries or poorer developing countries in need of assistance (Kindiki et al., 2019).\\n\\nThe motivation for managing and/or taking part in a research collaboration project can be either intrinsic or extrinsic, a mixture of both. Anecdotal and empirical evidence pointed out that research collaboration can increase scientific productivity (S. Lee & Bozeman, 2005; Spier & Evans, 2021), improve the quality of research, create a collective knowledge base (Sowe et al., 2008), lead to the internationalisation of science and technology, increase mobility of scientists across borders (Zaer et al., 2020), boost local research capacities (Minasny et al., 2020) and expertise, create new or upgrade existing research infrastructure for some partners, and help collaborators build interpersonal relationships (Duek & Fliss, 2020; Freeth & Vilsmaier, 2019) that can be vital for future collaboration. Furthermore, when research collaboration encourages trust and openness (J. Lee & Haupt, 2020) between partners and institutions, it can become an essential tool for supporting interdisciplinary research in the humanities (Maina-Ahlberg et al., 1997), brain science (Grasenick & Guerrero, 2020), health (Bian & Lin, 2020), education (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; The Lancet, 2020), environmental (Porter & Birdi, 2018) and medical sciences (Mummery, 2020), engineering (Sowe et al., 2008), or foster academia-industry collaboration (Marijan & Gotlieb, 2020).\\n\\nShenhar and Dvir (2007) pointed out that most projects fail and many projects do not accomplish their desired results. Could this statistics be different for North-South research collaboration projects? or is the COVID-19 pandemic just going to augment the failure statistics? Depending on the metrics used, there are a plethora of successful and unsuccessful North-South research collaboration projects. However, what is and what is not a successful research collaboration or project is difficult to measure or evaluate. Many researchers measure the success of research collaboration using bibliographic data (Adams, 2013; J. Lee & Haupt, 2020). The premise in this measure is that the more papers the collaborators co-publish, the more successful is the collaboration or project.\\n\\nSowe et al. (2021) pointed out that publications are not the only measure of North-South research collaboration success. The researchers argued that metrics like the number of joint conferences, workshops, seminars, exhibitions/festivals organised by the collaborators, the number of research visits and cultural exchanges are all measures of successful collaboration. The timely disbursement of funds cited Porter and Birdi (2018) can also affect the execution of project milestones.\\n\\nSocio-cultural misunderstanding, conflicting ideas or approaches to a topic, individual researcher's competence (Maina-Ahlberg et al., 1997), can all be barriers to successful international research collaboration, especially between researchers in the global North and South. Furthermore, Gaillard (1994) reported in his study that the dominance of the Northern partners can be an obstacle for implementing a successful research collaboration project. This dominance or imbalance is synonymous with what Minasny et al. (2020) called \\\"Helicopter research\\\". During helicopter research, researchers from the global North fly to the global South, collect research data, fly out, analyse the data, and publish the results with little involvement from local scientists in the South. Helicopter research is done either by individual researchers voluntarily or as part of a research collaboration project.\\n\\nThe mobility restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect this is having on conventional work practices (Sein, 2020) means that research collaboration is only effectively possible because of collaboration and coordination technologies and the fact that researchers can work online and from home (Sowe et al., 2021). Many studies found out that researchers are using various technologies to help them cope with the pandemic and continue their research (Grasenick and Guerrero, 2020; Rogers, 2020; Zaer et al., 2020). For project managers in general, Watts (2021) observed that the New Normal (Rogers, 2020) is characterised by online video meetings, document sharing, the use of messaging platforms, and non-stop Zoom calls.\\n\\n### Research collaboration during the pandemic\\n\\nApart from ushering in new communication and collaboration challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic also provides a unique opportunity for researchers to understand the dynamics of research collaboration projects and engage with research collaborators in new ways. For instance, J. Lee and Haupt, 2020 report that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, countries with lower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) tend to participate more in open-access scientific publications than their counterpart in countries with higher GDP. The Mawazo Institute Survey Report, (Mawazo, 2020), found out that 72.5% of respondents suspended their lab research because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Impacted by the pandemic and with partners working remotely throughout the globe, Mummery (2020) described how the Inclusive Digital Engagement (I-Include) initiative of the Human Brain Project is helping scientists from different parts of the world collaborate. Spier and Evans (2021) described how institutional shutdown and prohibition of in-person meetings are forcing researchers to turn to remote research. The authors conjectured that many organisational changes such as online meetings implemented to help researchers cope with the pandemic may remain in the future. Zaer et al. (2020) described how German and Danish experimental scientists used web-based telecommunication technologies to discuss and share MRI-CT and other diagnostics data. Furthermore, in responding to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Labour Organization launched the South-South and Triangular Cooperation initiative targeting 75 countries in the global South. One of the major prerequisites that project applicants must satisfy is the provision of knowledge exchange and a virtual meeting platform.\\n\\nThus, researchers from both the global North and South who can access and use the internet and collaboration technologies to remotely \\\"talk\\\" to collaborators whilst working from home are immensely advantaged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, research collaboration will be impacted for researchers lacking affordable and stable internet access at home, especially in the global South (Duek and Fliss, 2020).\\n\\n## 3 Methodology\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the methodology we used to collect the data needed to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for North-South research collaboration projects. |\n",

      "|  6 | After addressing the feedback from the pilot group, we modified and deployed the survey online. Some of the feedback included removing the mandatory option for some of the questions. The finalised questionnaire contained 25 questions spread across four sections presented in Table 1.\\n2. **Deployment**: The survey was freely hosted by [https://survey-consulting.com](https://survey-consulting.com), founded by Dr. Marcel Minke. The survey was in open-access mode, which means that participants can freely access the survey by clicking the link we sent them. Snowballing technique (Muqattash et al., 2020) was used to ask potential respondents to send the survey link to their colleagues who may be interested in the survey topic. One advantage of this technique is the multiplier effect - allowing the person who receives the survey link to nominate two or more others. Participation in the survey was not mandatory but based on availability and willingness to take part. We announced the survey on various mailing lists, social media channels and selected research networks. During the follow-ups, participants were contacted via Zoom, Microsoft teams, and WhatsApp to discuss their responses.\\n3. **Data, Pre-processing and Analysis**: The survey data was downloaded from the Limesurvey MySQL database and exported as CSV for analysis using the R statistical and Data Analysis software (R Core Team, 2020). Data preprocessing included converting questions into coded variables and removing incomplete answers that do not contain the information needed to answer the research questions.\\n\\n## 4 Results and Analysis\\n\\nFigure 2 shows our analysis framework. As sketched, we used various qualitative and quantitative metrics to analyse responses to the questions in the questionnaire. The analysis begins with a description of the demographic characteristics of the respondents. The research collaboration infrastructure and the research collaboration (home) environment sections are then analysed and used to answer the research questions (stated in Subsection 1.2). The analysis proceeds with an exposition of respondents opinions about research collaboration during the pandemic. Information obtained during the semi-structured follow-up interviews (Figure 1) is also analysed and used to enrich the analysis.\\n\\n### Data Set\\n\\nThe survey was activated online on January 15, 2021. After 3.5 months, on April 30, 2021, we collected 1320 responses (100 full + 1220 partial responses). A partial response was created in the survey database whenever someone clicks the survey link and closes the window without completing the survey. A partial response can also contain data for one or more answered questions. A full response was recorded in the database whenever someone completes the mandatory questions and clicks the _Submit Survey_ button.\\n\\n### Demographic characteristics of the participants\\n\\nA total of 102 people, from 33 countries responded to the country of residence question. The mean number of respondents per country is 3.09 (Median = 2.00, Std. Deviation = 5.192). However, the country of residence data is skewed (Skewness = 4.672, Kurtosis = 24.002) because respondents from Germany and Nigeria alone account for more than a third (38%) of all the respondents from the 33 countries. The global North-South distribution of the countries according to the Wikimedia 2021 regional classification of countries is shown in Table 2.\\n\\n\\\\nTable 2: Global distribution of the respondents\\n\\nFigure 2: Framework for analysing research collaboration projects during the pandemic.\\n\\nIn terms of age, most of the respondents (30%) are in the 35-44 years age range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

The gender distribution was 54% male and 42% female. As shown in Figure 3, nearly half of the respondents are researchers (43%), followed by 35% of the respondents who categorise themselves as university professors. Teachers and lecturers (22%) and doctoral and postdoctoral candidates (17%) are the 3\\\\({}^{rd}\\\\) and 4\\\\({}^{th}\\\\) largest professions. 4% indicated that they belong to another profession not captured by the survey. Principal investigators (PIs) and research collaboration project managers account for 10% of the population studied.\\n\\nWhen asked about their research area or field of study, more than a half (53%) of the respondents indicated that they are specialising in the Social Sciences and Humanities and 16% indicated that they are specialising in Computer Science and Information Technology. 4% of the respondents are specialising in each of the following fields: Business and Management, Education, Media and Communications, and Environmental, Agricultural, and Physical Sciences. 60% of the respondents work in the public sector, 9% in the private sector, 5% in the nonprofit sector, and over three-quarters are affiliated with a Cluster of Excellence. The Clusters of Excellence are funded by the Germany's Excellence Strategy (DFG). With the latter affiliation, about 72% of the respondents are working in Clusters of Excellence located in the global North while the remaining participants (19.4%) are working in Clusters of Excellence located in the global South.\\n\\nFurthermore, Figure 4 shows that 80% of the respondents were already involved in a research project when the survey was administered. 37.5% (N = 57) reported that their research project started before the pandemic and funding is continuing for 17.8% of them. However, for those with projects running during the pandemic, 15.5% reported that some project activities (e.g. meetings, conferences, workshops, field trips) were not funded.

When asked about where (global North or South) the majority of their projects partners are located, about 40% indicated that their partners are in the global South (e.g. Africa), more than a third (35.06%) indicated that their partners are in the global North (e.g. Western Europe), and 19% indicated that their partners are equally distributed between the global North and South.\\n\\nIn the following subsections 4.1 and 4.2 we summarise and analyse the research questions. To emphasise the differences between responses from the global North and the global South, we use an independent non-parametric _t_-test where we group respondents based on their answer to the question, \\\"Where do you work?\\\". We chose the workplace grouping as the demographic data shows that 60% of the respondents work in the public sector, and over three-quarters are affiliated with a Cluster of Excellence (\\\\(>\\\\) 70% in the global North and \\\\(>\\\\) 20 in the global South). For all the results subsequently analysed, we aggregated responses to each of the items based on the classification of the workplaces and applied the _t_-test to the two groups. The Tables 3-5 depict the mean values together with the standard deviation for both groups. The result of the _t_-test is also given in the form of a p-value. Significant differences are highlighted with an asterisk (*) for a level of \\\\(p<0.5\\\\) and two asterisks (**) for a p-value of \\\\(p<0.01\\\\).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",
      "|  8 | The survey contained simple Yes/No-questions, as well as Likert-scaled questions with either 3 or 10 choices. To support understandability of the results listed in the Tables 3-5, we mentioned the scale at the beginning of each question explaining the meaning of the corresponding numbers.\\n\\nIn the survey, participants indicated that their use of Zoom, WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex, and Skype has significantly (\\\\(p<0.05\\\\), 2-tailed) increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other technologies not included in the survey also registered an increase in use during the pandemic. For example, as indicated by _respondent ID108 from the global South_, WeChat is another research collaboration platform commonly used in China. However, as shown in Figure 5 and Table 3, there is significance difference in the way North-South research collaborators use WhatsApp (\\\\(p=0.000103\\\\)**), Skype (\\\\(p=0.000268\\\\)**), and Google Meet, previously called Google Hangouts Meet (\\\\(p=0.013286\\\\)*).

Dev. = 32.38) and 14.2 online meetings (N = 90, Std. Dev. = 17.36) using telephone or mobile. During these online meetings, users encountered numerous challenges (Figure 6). For instance, 19% of the people surveyed reported low bandwidth and insufficient internet connection problems. In addition, audio and video quality problems were reported by 18% and 16% of the respondents, respectively. There are no significant differences (_p_ = 0.407634) in these challenges between the global South (\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\)) and North (\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\)) groups.\\n\\nAlthough respondents from the two groups answered differently. For example, for the internet connection and insufficient internet bandwidth problem, the values were mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.6176 (n=34), std\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.4933 and mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.5303 (n=66), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.5029. When asked to indicate the platforms they are using to collaborate with their colleague, most of the respondents chose other collaboration platforms not represented in the survey. However, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Facebook and LinkedIn are also popular platforms among respondents.

      "|  9 | 10% are working from home but sometimes go to their offices to work on their research projects. The average number of countries visited by the respondents was 1.11 (Std. Dev. = 0.89), and the maximum number of countries visited by one individual from the global North was 4.\\n\\nWhen asked to rank the factors affecting their ability to work from home, participants from both the global North and South reported that the most significant effect (of the lockdown) is the lack of direct face-to-face contact with colleagues (Figure 7 and Table 4). Researchers also have difficulty in contacting research partners and scheduling meetings when working from home.\\n\\nFurthermore, when asked to rank what distracts them most when working from home, most people reported that children are the most distracting. Distractions from phone calls and messaging and other forms of distractions not captured in the survey also rank high amongst the respondents. Table 4 shows that there is a significant difference between the way people from the global South and global North ranked distractions from neighbours (_p_ = 0.001066**) and TV and Radio (_p_ = 0.009073**).\\n\\nFigure 7: Factors affecting research collaboration when working from home.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Opinions: Research collaboration during the pandemic\\n\\nTable 5 represents a comparative analysis of opinions from global North and South research collaborators. Figure 8 shows that the most notable impact of the lockdown is on local and international events such as meetings, workshops, or conferences. Perhaps this explains why survey participants cited the lack of face-to-face contact with colleagues\\n\\n\\\\nTable 4: Comparative analysis of the North-South research environment questionsas the most significant impact of the lockdown. This impact is not surprising because face-to-face contacts are common occurrences at pre-pandemic local and international events.\\n\\nIn addition to international and local events, the lockdown has also impacted people involved in laboratory and fieldwork. Table 5 shows that, even though a different number of people answered this question, there is no significant difference between the global North and South (mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 2.1923 (n=26), mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 2.2364 (n=55)). Table 6 summarises comments made by some of the survey participants (e.g. ID63, ID304, ID94, ID370) regarding the effect of the lockdown on laboratory and fieldwork and other research activities.\\n\\nWhen asked whether they would like to continue working from home after the lockdown, 34% of the respondents answered in the affirmative, 31% said \\\"No\\\", and 29% of them were undecided. As shown in Table 5, while the majority of the respondents are looking forward to the end of the lockdown, a sizable number (mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.6552 (n=29), mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.6885 (n=61)) of them also learnt a new set of skills or technologies during this period. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of how people from the global North and South responded to these statements revealed a significant difference. For instance, as indicated by the mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = -0.1111 and \\\\(p\\\\) = 0.004385** values in Table 5, while 67.2% of the respondents from the South felt more productive during the lockdown, their counterparts in the North felt otherwise. The reverse was true for \\\"I feel less productive\\\". A significant number (_p_ = 0.014430*) of respondents from the global South also answered \\\"Yes\\\" to \\\"Sometimes I have face-to-face meetings\\\" than their Northern counterparts. They also significantly (_p_ = 0.000025**) experienced more electricity power outage during the lockdown. The \\\"Yes\\\", \\\"No\\\" and \\\"Uncertain\\\" responses to these statsements are also illustrated in Figure 9.\\n\\nFigure 8: Effect of the pandemic on some aspects of research collaboration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\nTable 5: Comparative analysis of North-South research collaborators opinions\\n\\n\\\\nTable 6: Selected participants comments\\n\\n\\\\n\\n#### Opinions from Principal Investigators/Project Managers\\n\\nThe opinions of the 10% of the people who classified themselves as Principal Investigators/Project Managers in the demography analysis 4) is not that much different from the rest of the studied cohort. 60% of them (50% males and 50% females) come from the South whilst the other 40% are from the North. 70%) indicated that they are working from home in their own countries. 20% were working from home in another country, caught up by pandemic travel restrictions when completing the survey. The remaining 10% did not indicate their home location. Furthermore, seven out of ten had difficultyreaching out to research collaborators, making scheduling face-to-face meetings almost impossible. During the lockdown, 95% of the Investigators/Project Managers said that they have learnt a new set of skills or technology.\\n\\nWhen asked whether they would like to continue working from home after the lockdown, more than half of them said \\\"No\\\". Most of the PIs/project managers indicated that managing international and local research collaboration is either \\\"most affected\\\" or \\\"affected\\\". The group expressed that hiring new researchers, staff or student assistants is less affected by the pandemic.

      "| 10 | In particular, the dataset used in this study is a small dataset and by no means representative of the entire global North and South research collaboration population or projects. The dataset only consists of 64 respondents from 14 Northern countries and 38 respondents from 19 Southern countries. We also mentioned that the country of residence data is skewed because respondents from Germany and Nigeria alone account for more than a third of all the respondents from the 33 countries (ref. Table 2).\\n\\nWhile the North-South research collaboration data collection methodology presented in Figure 1 gave us all the instruments needed to craft a good survey, the questionnaire was not able to capture some elements where the participants expressed strong opinions. For example, there is no way of knowing from the demographic data the profession of 4% of the people surveyed, the other technologies and platforms researchers are using to collaborate with their colleagues (discussed in Section 4.1), or the other forms of distractions research collaborators encounter when working from home.\\n\\n## 5 Discussion\\n\\nIrrespective of the geographical location, the status of the research collaboration infrastructure (technology and platforms used to collaborate with colleagues), and research collaboration (home) environment, many researchers managed to continue working fromhome on their research collaboration projects that started before the pandemic. A small number (10%) of the researchers are working from both home and office. But working from home does not mean that researchers are not mobile. We reported that, on average, every respondent visited at least one country (mean =1.11) during the pandemic. Some people in the global North visited two or more (max. = 4) countries.\\n\\n### North-South research collaboration infrastructure during the pandemic\\n\\nAs attested by Archibald et al. (2019), Sein (2020) and Zaer et al. (2020), the COVID-19 crisis has forced people to embrace collaboration and coordination technologies for working online and from home. Many studies, for instance, (Grasenick & Guerrero, 2020; Rogers, 2020; Zaer et al., 2020), found out that researchers are using various technologies to help them cope with the pandemic and continue their research.\\n\\nInteresting about the research collaboration infrastructure (Subsection 4.1 and Table 5) is that not only the use of some technologies increased, decreased or stayed the same during the pandemic, but the pandemic provided researchers from both the global North and South the opportunity to learn a new set of skills or technologies. All the people surveyed indicated that their use of Zoom increased during the pandemic. Despite the challenges, videoconferencing software provides opportunities to connect and discuss research progress with colleagues. As one global South collaborator, _South/ID334_, commented in Table 6, _\\\"...I can work peacefully at home...meetings in Zoom... are possible-but it is difficult to discuss all the nuances of the research project\\\"_.\\n\\nThe increase in the use of zoom and other videoconferencing technologies (WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, Skype) during the pandemic is also an increase in online meetings, which might, in turn, lead to what Rogers (2020) referred to as \\\"Zoom fatigue\\\". We cannot infer fatigue from our data, but the group studied had 44.76 online meetings using a computer, Laptop or Tablet and 14.2 online meetings using telephone or mobile. Meaning not a single working day goes by without a Zoom meeting. A paradox on the devices used for online meetings during the pandemic is that, according to the International Telecommunication Union statistics, the developing world (global South) outnumbers the developed world (global North) by 6:1 when it comes to Mobile-cellular subscriptions. However, we found out that, during the same period, researchers in the global North (e.g. Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, France, Japan) had twice as many online meetings using telephone or mobile as their counterparts in the global South (e.g. Indonesia, Costa Rica).\\n\\nThe research collaboration infrastructure with all its associated challenges provides an opportunity for researchers to address some of the most pressing research collaboration problems posed by the pandemic such as the lack of face-to-face contact with colleagues and the difficulty in reaching out to research collaborators. Consequently, as argued by Duek and Fliss (2020), research collaboration will be impacted for researchers lacking the appropriate infrastructure (e.g. affordable and stable internet access) but will be enhanced for those who can access and use collaboration technologies to \\\"talk\\\" to collaborators whilst working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nIn this study, the lack of or slow internet connection, cost of mobile data, lack of electricity and appropriate equipment such as laptop or headphone for videoconferencing is ranked high by researchers from the global South. A stark contrast was observed on how the lack of electricity (_p_ = 0.000465**), internet connection (_p_ = 0.002610**) and the cost of mobile data (_p_ = 0.000251**) is affecting researchers from the global South to engage in research collaboration while working from home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",
      "| 11 | meetings, workshops, conferences, fieldwork) because of travel restrictions. The highlight is lucidly captured in the comments made by some of the survey respondents in Table 6. For example, respondent _South/ID63_ commented that if it were not for the pandemic, his team would have completed the fieldwork they scheduled for September 2020. Respondent _North/370_ felt sad that the workshop he organised with South African and European partners did not take place because of the lockdown. Another participant (_North/ID304_) commented that the lockdown did not allow them to visit their research site and collaborate with other researchers.\\n\\nIn addition to using videoconferencing tools to support North-South research collaboration, researchers also used several social media and research platforms to collaborate with their colleagues. We found out that ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Facebook and LinkedIn, in that order, are the most favoured platforms by researchers from both the global North and South. Cloud storage services for sharing research data are dominated by Google Drive and DropBox, with 64% of the users coming from the global North and 57.4% from the global South.\\n\\n### North-South research collaboration (home) environment during the pandemic\\n\\nTrying to stay focused while working from home has become the new normal for many people. In this study, researchers from both the North and South indicated that children and phone calls and text messaging are the most distracting when they work from home (see Table 4). Generally, we also found out that respondents from the North are less distracted by neighbours (mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 8.5536 (n=56), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 2.5220, \\\\(p\\\\) = 0.009073**) and TV and Radio (mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 8.3818 (n=55), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 2.7588, \\\\(p\\\\) = 0.009073**) than their counterparts in the South. Specifically, except for the participants from 4 countries in the global South (South Africa, Nigeria, China, Costa Rica), all other participants who gave rank 10 (less distracting) to distractions from neighbours are from the global North.\\n\\nIt was not only the case that we could not find consensus amongst the researchers when asked whether they would like to continue working from home after the lockdown (\\\"Yes\\\" = 34%, \\\"No\\\" = 31%, \\\"Undecided\\\" = 29%), but the majority of them (94%) said that they are looking forward to the end of the lockdown. Maybe the researchers in our dataset want the lockdown to end but continue working from home most of the time? In connection with this conjecture is the argument advanced by Spier and Evans (2021) that institutional shutdown and the prohibition of physical contacts has forced researchers to turn to remote research because of some of the organisational changes (teleworking). Table 5 also lists other self-esteem and environmental factors that come into play when working from home during the pandemic. For instance, more than two-thirds (67.2%) of the respondents from the global South felt more productive during the pandemic than their Northern counterparts.\\n\\n## 6 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we presented an approach, a methodology, and a framework for studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for North-South research collaboration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

We used the analytical framework to explain how we applied an independent nonparametric _t_-test and other statistical measures to analyse the survey data we obtained from 102 researchers coming from 33 different countries.\\n\\nThe results and discussion presented helped us understand the complex nature of research collaboration projects and how the pandemic has changed the way project managers used to manager research projects prior to the pandemic.

      "| 13 | The activities may include project planning and tracking, managing project resources (human and research material), estimating and calculating costs, schedule management (conference, research visits), risk and communication management. Of course, for any project, research or otherwise, delays, inefficiencies, and rising costs can occur when executing any of the above activities. In a blog post, Camelia, 2022 argued that for many organizations, including Clusters of Excellence in Universities, problems associated with remote project management are not new. She argues that a project (research or otherwise) with the right tools and clear communication and collaboration strategy can succeed. She highlighted two essential requirements for success:\\n\\n* a project with the right technical equipment (computer, internet connection, remote access to company software), and\\n* a project in which most of the members have the right technical equipment (computer, internet connection, remote access to software), and the scope of work and responsibilities are clearly defined.\\n\\nBut this is remote research project management during a pandemic where almost all research collaboration activities are remote and online. Although a small percentage (10%), the research collaboration project managers in this study learned a new set of skills or technology to help them address the challenges associated with remote research project management. An interview with one of the project managers revealed that his online presence has increased. He has learned to use various tech platforms for messaging and audio/video communication with project partners. His online interaction with project members provides him with visibility, leading to improvement in collaboration to achieve greater productivity in the project. In terms of the technical research infrastructure and home environment, there are significant differences between the global North and South.\\n\\nThus, we posit that this research can potentially add to our understanding of the nature of research collaboration and how to manage research collaboration projects involving partners from the global North and South. The empirical study can also act as a best-practice guideline or lessons learnt dossier for project management professionals and Clusters of Excellence and universities interested in pursuing or

Figure 2) and a modified version of the current survey ([https://tinyurl.com/y3rcukkk](https://tinyurl.com/y3rcukkk)) to investigate post-pandemic North-South research collaboration projects. We posit this will give us more insight into the tools and techniques researchers and project managers used to cope with the pandemic. Besides, as discussed in the research methodology (ref. Figure 1), we are planning to conduct more semi-structured interviews with the 10% of the survey respondents who classified themselves as principal investigators/project managers.\\n\\n## 7

      "|  0 | Managing North-South Research Collaboration Projects\\n\\nDuring the COVID-19 Pandemic. An Empirical Study\\n\\nAnonymous author(s)\\n\\n**Abstract**\\n\\nResearchers from the global North and South have collaborated for decades to conduct cutting-edge interdisciplinary research. The tools they used to manage their research projects remained virtually unchanged until the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak early in 2020. Since then, a lot has changed, including the nature and dynamics of research collaboration. How are researchers and project managers adapting to this change? Survey data, semi-structured interviews, and personal accounts from 102 respondents from 33 countries are used in this empirical study to investigate the impact of the pandemic on research collaboration projects. An independent non-parametric t-test revealed a significant difference in the research collaboration infrastructure and home environment between global North and global South collaborators. The findings have practical implications for people involved in collaborative research projects, funding agencies, project management professionals, and universities interested in pursuing or sustaining North-South research collaboration during the pandemic.\\n\\n**Keywords:** COVID-19 pandemic, Social distancing, New Normal, Global North-South, Project Management, Collaborative research projects, Clusters of Excellence, Online Survey.\\n\\n \\n\\n## 1 Introduction\\n\\nIn collaborative research, a globally distributed, sometimes co-located team of researchers work together to address research questions pertinent to their study. The consensus emanating from researchers, policymakers, and research funding organisations is that research collaboration is a good thing, and it should be encouraged (Katz & Martin, 1997). Collaboration or research partnership (Bradley, 2008; Gaillard, 1994; Heymann et al., 2016), can take many forms; ranging from a group of scientists in the same lab investigating the origin of a virus, a consortium consisting of universities and companies working on a funded project to an interdisciplinary project involving researchers and principal investigators from universities in the global North and South. Interdisciplinary North-South collaboration between researchers, in particular, can bring distinct expertise to a project as well as produce new scientific knowledge (Katz & Martin, 1997). Furthermore, as acknowledged by J. Lee and Haupt (2020), research collaboration benefits not only low-income (Southern) but also high-income (Northern) countries as well.\\n\\nThe main characteristic of North-South research collaboration is that researchers are often geographically dispersed. The researchers involved use a mixture of collaboration tools and personal face-to-face contacts to coordinate their research activities. Under normal circumstances, they can travel and meet in small groups to discuss their research in a workshop, seminar or conference. Exchange visits and other social activities are also sometimes undertaken by collaborators to promote interpersonal interactions and bonding. Researchers can also use emails, video conferencing, or social media platforms to communicate with their colleagues when the need arises.\\n\\nHowever, since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 on 30 January 2020 to be a public health emergency of international concern, many \\\"normal\\\" research collaboration activities have almost become impossible. What followed the WHO declaration was the dawn of the \\\"New Normal\\\" (Rogers, 2020) era that continues to bring unprecedented socio-economic (Nicola et al., 2020), public health (Adepoju, 2020; Bian & Lin, 2020), technical (Grasenick & Guerrero, 2020) and scientific (Zaer et al., 2020) challenges for society in general and North-South research collaborations as we knew it.\\n\\n### Motivation\\n\\nAs members of the Africa Multiple Cluster of Excellence1 at the University of Bayreuth, Germany, the authors are involved in several open collaboration research projects with partners from the global North (e.g. Europe) and global South (e.g. Africa). The research projects are parts of the Clusters of Excellence research projects funded by the German Excellence Strategy. Cluster members have a long history of interdisciplinary North-South research collaboration. The aim of the Cluster, among other things, is to develop a digital research environment for reconfiguring African Studies (Seesemann,2020). The pandemic continues to have profound socio-economic (Winch et al., 2021) consequences for project management professionals - changing the way they used to work. Like many other collaborative projects, we are also heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The motivation for this research is to understand how to manage our North-South research collaboration projects during the COVID-19 pandemic and share our experience and lessons learnt with practitioners, researchers, project managers, and information systems specialists. Project management uses specific tools and techniques to deliver a valuable product to the people or communities concerned. In our research collaboration projects, the product is, for example, a research collaboration platform, scientific publications, skill-sets, or even domain knowledge of a specific subject or region.\\n\\nTo develop a thorough understanding of project management during the pandemic means that our analysis must help us understand the challenges involved in managing the resources and outputs of the projects. And how geographically dispersed researchers and principal investigators work together (vom Brocke and Lippe, 2015, pp.10, 19). Noting that the chance of face-to-face meetings and knowledge exchanges among researchers might not be possible during the pandemic, we also need to understand the communication technologies and strategy project professionals are using to overcome geographical distance (vom Brocke and Lippe, 2015).\\n\\n### Contribution and research questions\\n\\nMany countries have implemented measures to help reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV2 virus and its OMICRON variant. Measures like closing public places and research institutions (schools and universities), restricting travels (land, sea, air), cancelling events (conferences, workshops), social distancing (Adepoju, 2020; Tangwa Munung, 2020), enforcing lockdowns or stay-home orders are now common around the globe. However, some countries are beginning to lift some of these restrictions because of public pressure (Burki, 2021).\\n\\nAlthough these measures resulted in the cancellation of some research collaboration projects and activities, others continued and adapted to the COVID-19 crisis by embracing collaboration and coordination technologies for remote work (Zaer et al., 2020), and at the same time, new projects started in Europe, the Americas, Africa, the Pacific and ASEAN regions.\\n\\nThe pandemic is not only impacting the way we conduct research locally, between universities nationally and internationally, but it has propelled North-South research collaboration to the forefront of public discourse in both the public and private sectors. Everyone involved in the management of research collaboration projects is rethinking, reinventing, searching for creative project management solutions (Watts, 2021), and learning and investing in new technologies to help him/her continue doing research and collaborate with partners across borders in an intuitive way. Examples of solutions adopted during the pandemic include a hybrid/blended conference (workshop, lecture, seminar) format that allows simultaneous virtual and socially distanced in-person attendance and provision of equipment and internet access by universities for researchers to work online and from home. Furthermore, Zaer et al. (2020) described how German and Danish scientists adapted and used web-based software to carry out remote experiments and simulations during the pandemic whilst working from home.\\n\\nA review of the literature on managing research collaboration during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that many studies emphasised the importance of research collaboration in general (Bian and Lin, 2020; J. Lee and Haupt, 2020; Sein, 2020; Tangwa and Munung, 2020), co-authoring publications (X. Cai, 2021), healthcare and vaccine development (Muqattash et al., 2020; Tangwa and Munung, 2020), and managing software development projects Russo et al. (2021), project management case study (Wahbi et al., 2020), to mention a few. Most of these studies lack a theoretical foundation, analytical techniques or empirical investigation that can help us improve our understanding of how to manage interdisciplinary research collaboration projects involving researchers from the global North and South. Thus, best practices and lessons learnt to support interdisciplinary North-South research collaboration project management during the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking in the literature.\\n\\nNorth-South research collaboration projects are complex entities involving people working in different places. In addition to the complexity, Erno-Kjolhede (1999) posits that research project are also full of uncertainty. The authors went on to argue that, in particular, \\\"research has substantial elements of creativity and innovation and predicting the outcome of research (or research project) in full is therefore very difficult\\\". Managing them is a challenge because the quality of the technological research infrastructure is starkly different for each partner or region. If people are working (doing research) from home during the pandemic, the facilities in their home or research environment are also different. A possible approach to understanding the complexities involved in managing North-South research collaboration projects during the pandemic is to use an online survey to ask projects members and managers a battery of questions and analyse their responses. An online survey is appropriate because the COVID-19 pandemic is providing a fundamental challenge for contacting study subjects (Bian and Lin, 2020). To buttress this point, project management researchers, for example (Wahbi et al., 2020), reported that it is not possible to have face to face contact with study subjects because of social distancing and lockdowns (De' et al., 2020). Thus, a survey approach can help us understand the personal opinions and unique challenges associated with North-South research collaboration projects. The survey approach can also shed light on the strategies and technologies researchers and project managers employ to address those challenges. Therefore, this study attempts to answer a series of research questions broadly grouped into the two major sections described below:\\n\\n1. Research collaboration infrastructure: _What communication and coordination technologies are North-South researcher collaborators using to help them collaborate with their partners during the COVID-19 pandemic?_ Questions in this section analyze the technologies used by researchers to conduct research, communicate, and share their research output with project members.\\n\\nThe challenges research collaborators (researchers and project managers) face in using the technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.\\n2. Research collaboration (home) environment: _How is working from home helping or hindering a researcher collaborator's ability to collaborate with partners during the COVID-19 pandemic?_ Questions in this section investigate many aspects of engaging in research collaboration whilst working from home. For example, how working from home affects the mobility of the researchers, the distractions they face, internet connectivity problems, etc.\\n\\nThe two sections and questions are part of an online survey questionnaire targeting global North and South researchers and project managers. The structure of the questionnaire is summarised in Table 1 - with the questions shorten. The full survey structure and questions is available at [https://tinyurl.com/y3rcukkk](https://tinyurl.com/y3rcukkk). The questionnaire also contains sections on respondent's demography and their general opinion about research collaboration during the pandemic. The online survey ran for about 3.5 months (January 15 - April 30, 2021).\\n\\n\\\\nTable 1: Structure of the survey questionnaire \\n\\n## 2 Background and Related Work\\n\\nResearch collaboration projects are exciting to study because of their multidimensional and interdisciplinary nature. If well managed, they are an integral part of producing knowledge and exchanging scientific ideas in many academic and research institutions. |\n",
      "|  1 | According to (Sowe et al., 2021), a research collaboration project consists of partners locally situated within a country (e.g. Germany or Nigeria), region (e.g. Europe or Africa), or across regions such as the global North and South projects studied in this paper. Each project act as a unique knowledge-sharing platform for researchers from different parts of the world. Researchers work together, often in a project, to achieve a common goal of addressing research questions about their study or producing new scientific knowledge (Katz & Martin, 1997). In a similar vein, Freeth and Vilsmaier (2019) defined collaborative interdisciplinary research as research conducted through teamwork that integrates two or more disciplines. Some researchers, for example, Heymann et al. (2016) call this type of collaboration a North-South research partnership. Others take a socio-economic dimension and argue that the North-South dichotomy categorises nations as either being rich, developed countries or poorer developing countries in need of assistance (Kindiki et al., 2019).\\n\\nThe motivation for managing and/or taking part in a research collaboration project can be either intrinsic or extrinsic, a mixture of both. Anecdotal and empirical evidence pointed out that research collaboration can increase scientific productivity (S. Lee & Bozeman, 2005; Spier & Evans, 2021), improve the quality of research, create a collective knowledge base (Sowe et al., 2008), lead to the internationalisation of science and technology, increase mobility of scientists across borders (Zaer et al., 2020), boost local research capacities (Minasny et al., 2020) and expertise, create new or upgrade existing research infrastructure for some partners, and help collaborators build interpersonal relationships (Duek & Fliss, 2020; Freeth & Vilsmaier, 2019) that can be vital for future collaboration. Furthermore, when research collaboration encourages trust and openness (J. Lee & Haupt, 2020) between partners and institutions, it can become an essential tool for supporting interdisciplinary research in the humanities (Maina-Ahlberg et al., 1997), brain science (Grasenick & Guerrero, 2020), health (Bian & Lin, 2020), education (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; The Lancet, 2020), environmental (Porter & Birdi, 2018) and medical sciences (Mummery, 2020), engineering (Sowe et al., 2008), or foster academia-industry collaboration (Marijan & Gotlieb, 2020).\\n\\nShenhar and Dvir (2007) pointed out that most projects fail and many projects do not accomplish their desired results. Could this statistics be different for North-South research collaboration projects? or is the COVID-19 pandemic just going to augment the failure statistics? Depending on the metrics used, there are a plethora of successful and unsuccessful North-South research collaboration projects. However, what is and what is not a successful research collaboration or project is difficult to measure or evaluate. Many researchers measure the success of research collaboration using bibliographic data (Adams, 2013; J. Lee & Haupt, 2020). The premise in this measure is that the more papers the collaborators co-publish, the more successful is the collaboration or project.\\n\\nSowe et al. (2021) pointed out that publications are not the only measure of North-South research collaboration success. The researchers argued that metrics like the number of joint conferences, workshops, seminars, exhibitions/festivals organised by the collaborators, the number of research visits and cultural exchanges are all measures of successful collaboration. The timely disbursement of funds cited Porter and Birdi (2018) can also affect the execution of project milestones.\\n\\nSocio-cultural misunderstanding, conflicting ideas or approaches to a topic, individual researcher's competence (Maina-Ahlberg et al., 1997), can all be barriers to successful international research collaboration, especially between researchers in the global North and South. Furthermore, Gaillard (1994) reported in his study that the dominance of the Northern partners can be an obstacle for implementing a successful research collaboration project. This dominance or imbalance is synonymous with what Minasny et al. (2020) called \\\"Helicopter research\\\". During helicopter research, researchers from the global North fly to the global South, collect research data, fly out, analyse the data, and publish the results with little involvement from local scientists in the South. Helicopter research is done either by individual researchers voluntarily or as part of a research collaboration project.\\n\\nThe mobility restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect this is having on conventional work practices (Sein, 2020) means that research collaboration is only effectively possible because of collaboration and coordination technologies and the fact that researchers can work online and from home (Sowe et al., 2021). Many studies found out that researchers are using various technologies to help them cope with the pandemic and continue their research (Grasenick and Guerrero, 2020; Rogers, 2020; Zaer et al., 2020). For project managers in general, Watts (2021) observed that the New Normal (Rogers, 2020) is characterised by online video meetings, document sharing, the use of messaging platforms, and non-stop Zoom calls.\\n\\n### Research collaboration during the pandemic\\n\\nApart from ushering in new communication and collaboration challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic also provides a unique opportunity for researchers to understand the dynamics of research collaboration projects and engage with research collaborators in new ways. For instance, J. Lee and Haupt, 2020 report that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, countries with lower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) tend to participate more in open-access scientific publications than their counterpart in countries with higher GDP. The Mawazo Institute Survey Report, (Mawazo, 2020), found out that 72.5% of respondents suspended their lab research because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Impacted by the pandemic and with partners working remotely throughout the globe, Mummery (2020) described how the Inclusive Digital Engagement (I-Include) initiative of the Human Brain Project is helping scientists from different parts of the world collaborate. Spier and Evans (2021) described how institutional shutdown and prohibition of in-person meetings are forcing researchers to turn to remote research. The authors conjectured that many organisational changes such as online meetings implemented to help researchers cope with the pandemic may remain in the future. Zaer et al. (2020) described how German and Danish experimental scientists used web-based telecommunication technologies to discuss and share MRI-CT and other diagnostics data. Furthermore, in responding to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Labour Organization launched the South-South and Triangular Cooperation initiative targeting 75 countries in the global South. One of the major prerequisites that project applicants must satisfy is the provision of knowledge exchange and a virtual meeting platform.\\n\\nThus, researchers from both the global North and South who can access and use the internet and collaboration technologies to remotely \\\"talk\\\" to collaborators whilst working from home are immensely advantaged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, research collaboration will be impacted for researchers lacking affordable and stable internet access at home, especially in the global South (Duek and Fliss, 2020).\\n\\n## 3 Methodology\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the methodology we used to collect the data needed to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for North-South research collaboration projects. Nieto et al. (2020) and Muqattash et al. (2020) used a similar survey instrument to collect data during the pandemic. The methodology is divided into three stages.\\n\\n1. **Preparation**: During the preparatory stage, we carried out a series of brainstorming sessions to discuss the types of questions to ask, under what sections the questions should appear, and the logic needed to redirect respo\\n\\nFigure 1: North-South research collaboration projects data collection methodology.\\n\\nof sketches, we designed the survey questionnaire using LimeSurvey (LimeSurvey Development Team, 2020). The questionnaire was then tested and piloted with a small group of researchers, principal investigators and research projects managers. After addressing the feedback from the pilot group, we modified and deployed the survey online. Some of the feedback included removing the mandatory option for some of the questions. The finalised questionnaire contained 25 questions spread across four sections presented in Table 1.\\n2. **Deployment**: The survey was freely hosted by [https://survey-consulting.com](https://survey-consulting.com), founded by Dr. Marcel Minke. The survey was in open-access mode, which means that participants can freely access the survey by clicking the link we sent them. Snowballing technique (Muqattash et al., 2020) was used to ask potential respondents to send the survey link to their colleagues who may be interested in the survey topic. One advantage of this technique is the multiplier effect - allowing the person who receives the survey link to nominate two or more others. Participation in the survey was not mandatory but based on availability and willingness to take part. We announced the survey on various mailing lists, social media channels and selected research networks. During the follow-ups, participants were contacted via Zoom, Microsoft teams, and WhatsApp to discuss their responses.\\n3. **Data, Pre-processing and Analysis**: The survey data was downloaded from the Limesurvey MySQL database and exported as CSV for analysis using the R statistical and Data Analysis software (R Core Team, 2020). Data preprocessing included converting questions into coded variables and removing incomplete answers that do not contain the information needed to answer the research questions.\\n\\n## 4 Results and Analysis\\n\\nFigure 2 shows our analysis framework. As sketched, we used various qualitative and quantitative metrics to analyse responses to the questions in the questionnaire. The analysis begins with a description of the demographic characteristics of the respondents. The research collaboration infrastructure and the research collaboration (home) environment sections are then analysed and used to answer the research questions (stated in Subsection 1.2). The analysis proceeds with an exposition of respondents opinions about research collaboration during the pandemic. Information obtained during the semi-structured follow-up interviews (Figure 1) is also analysed and used to enrich the analysis.\\n\\n### Data Set\\n\\nThe survey was activated online on January 15, 2021. After 3.5 months, on April 30, 2021, we collected 1320 responses (100 full + 1220 partial responses). A partial response was created in the survey database whenever someone clicks the survey link and closes the window without completing the survey. A partial response can also contain data for one or more answered questions. A full response was recorded in the database whenever someone completes the mandatory questions and clicks the _Submit Survey_ button.\\n\\n### Demographic characteristics of the participants\\n\\nA total of 102 people, from 33 countries responded to the country of residence question. The mean number of respondents per country is 3.09 (Median = 2.00, Std. Deviation = 5.192). However, the country of residence data is skewed (Skewness = 4.672, Kurtosis = 24.002) because respondents from Germany and Nigeria alone account for more than a third (38%) of all the respondents from the 33 countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",
      "|  2 | The global North-South distribution of the countries according to the Wikimedia 2021 regional classification of countries is shown in Table 2.\\n\\n\\\\nTable 2: Global distribution of the respondents\\n\\nFigure 2: Framework for analysing research collaboration projects during the pandemic.\\n\\nIn terms of age, most of the respondents (30%) are in the 35-44 years age range. Nobody was 75 years and older. The percentage of respondents in the other age ranges are as follows: 18-24 years = 1%, 25-34 years = 17%, 45-54 years = 28%, 55-64 years = 19%, and 65-74 years = 5%. The gender distribution was 54% male and 42% female. As shown in Figure 3, nearly half of the respondents are researchers (43%), followed by 35% of the respondents who categorise themselves as university professors. Teachers and lecturers (22%) and doctoral and postdoctoral candidates (17%) are the 3\\\\({}^{rd}\\\\) and 4\\\\({}^{th}\\\\) largest professions. 4% indicated that they belong to another profession not captured by the survey. Principal investigators (PIs) and research collaboration project managers account for 10% of the population studied.\\n\\nWhen asked about their research area or field of study, more than a half (53%) of the respondents indicated that they are specialising in the Social Sciences and Humanities and 16% indicated that they are specialising in Computer Science and Information Technology. 4% of the respondents are specialising in each of the following fields: Business and Management, Education, Media and Communications, and Environmental, Agricultural, and Physical Sciences. 60% of the respondents work in the public sector, 9% in the private sector, 5% in the nonprofit sector, and over three-quarters are affiliated with a Cluster of Excellence. The Clusters of Excellence are funded by the Germany's Excellence Strategy (DFG). With the latter affiliation, about 72% of the respondents are working in Clusters of Excellence located in the global North while the remaining participants (19.4%) are working in Clusters of Excellence located in the global South.\\n\\nFurthermore, Figure 4 shows that 80% of the respondents were already involved in a research project when the survey was administered. 37.5% (N = 57) reported that their research project started before the pandemic and funding is continuing for 17.8% of them. However, for those with projects running during the pandemic, 15.5% reported that some project activities (e.g. meetings, conferences, workshops, field trips) were not funded. While 17.8% were able to acquire funding for new research projects, 8.6% had\\n\\nFigure 3: Demographic characteristics of the participants by profession.\\n\\ntheir projects put on hold or discontinued (3.9%) during the pandemic. When asked about where (global North or South) the majority of their projects partners are located, about 40% indicated that their partners are in the global South (e.g. Africa), more than a third (35.06%) indicated that their partners are in the global North (e.g. Western Europe), and 19% indicated that their partners are equally distributed between the global North and South.\\n\\nIn the following subsections 4.1 and 4.2 we summarise and analyse the research questions. To emphasise the differences between responses from the global North and the global South, we use an independent non-parametric _t_-test where we group respondents based on their answer to the question, \\\"Where do you work?\\\". We chose the workplace grouping as the demographic data shows that 60% of the respondents work in the public sector, and over three-quarters are affiliated with a Cluster of Excellence (\\\\(>\\\\) 70% in the global North and \\\\(>\\\\) 20 in the global South). For all the results subsequently analysed, we aggregated responses to each of the items based on the classification of the workplaces and applied the _t_-test to the two groups. The Tables 3-5 depict the mean values together with the standard deviation for both groups. The result of the _t_-test is also given in the form of a p-value. Significant differences are highlighted with an asterisk (*) for a level of \\\\(p<0.5\\\\) and two asterisks (**) for a p-value of \\\\(p<0.01\\\\). For the items, we used different question types often with individual scales. The survey contained simple Yes/No-questions, as well as Likert-scaled questions with either 3 or 10 choices. To support understandability of the results listed in the Tables 3-5, we mentioned the scale at the beginning of each question explaining the meaning of the corresponding numbers.\\n\\nIn the survey, participants indicated that their use of Zoom, WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex, and Skype has significantly (\\\\(p<0.05\\\\), 2-tailed) increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other technologies not included in the survey also registered an increase in use during the pandemic. For example, as indicated by _respondent ID108 from the global South_, WeChat is another research collaboration platform commonly used in China. However, as shown in Figure 5 and Table 3, there is significance difference in the way North-South research collaborators use WhatsApp (\\\\(p=0.000103\\\\)**), Skype (\\\\(p=0.000268\\\\)**), and Google Meet, previously called Google Hangouts Meet (\\\\(p=0.013286\\\\)*). Since the use of Zoom has increased 100% during the pandemic for all the survey participants, \\\\(t\\\\)-test was not possible for this

Dev. = 32.38) and 14.2 online meetings (N = 90, Std. Dev. = 17.36) using telephone or mobile. During these online meetings, users encountered numerous challenges (Figure 6). For instance, 19% of the people surveyed reported low bandwidth and insufficient internet connection problems. In addition, audio and video quality problems were reported by 18% and 16% of the respondents, respectively. There are no significant differences (_p_ = 0.407634) in these challenges between the global South (\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\)) and North (\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\)) groups.\\n\\nAlthough respondents from the two groups answered differently. For example, for the internet connection and insufficient internet bandwidth problem, the values were mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.6176 (n=34), std\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.4933 and mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.5303 (n=66), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.5029. When asked to indicate the platforms they are using to collaborate with their colleague, most of the respondents chose other collaboration platforms not represented in the survey. However, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Facebook and LinkedIn are also popular platforms among respondents. As shown in Table 3, the cloud storage services for sharing research data is dominated by Google Drive (mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.7647 (n=34), std\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.4306 and mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.5303 (n=66), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.5029) and there is a significant difference (_p_ = 0.017324*) in the use of this service by research collaborators in the North and South. DropBox is the second preferred cloud storage for sharing research data (mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.4412 (n=34), std\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.5040 and mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.5758 (n=66), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.4980). Non of the respondents selected LiveDrive and Zoolz, but other cloud storage services (mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.2353 (n=34), std\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.4306 and mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.3788 (n=66), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.4888) are also commonly used by the collaborators.\\n\\nFigure 6: Problems encountered by research collaborators during online meetings.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Research collaboration (home) environment\\n\\n_How is working from home helping or hindering a researcher collaborator's ability to collaborate with partners during the COVID-19 pandemic?_\\n\\nMany people are slowly getting used to working from home during the pandemic. 85% of the people surveyed answered the \\\"Are you working from home?\\\" question in the affirmative. 10% are working from home but sometimes go to their offices to work on their research projects. The average number of countries visited by the respondents was 1.11 (Std. Dev. = 0.89), and the maximum number of countries visited by one individual from the global North was 4.\\n\\nWhen asked to rank the factors affecting their ability to work from home, participants from both the global North and South reported that the most significant effect (of the lockdown) is the lack of direct face-to-face contact with colleagues (Figure 7 and Table 4). Researchers also have difficulty in contacting research partners and scheduling meetings when working from home.\\n\\nFurthermore, when asked to rank what distracts them most when working from home, most people reported that children are the most distracting. Distractions from phone calls and messaging and other forms of distractions not captured in the survey also rank high amongst the respondents. Table 4 shows that there is a significant difference between the way people from the global South and global North ranked distractions from neighbours (_p_ = 0.001066**) and TV and Radio (_p_ = 0.009073**).\\n\\nFigure 7: Factors affecting research collaboration when working from home.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Opinions: Research collaboration during the pandemic\\n\\nTable 5 represents a comparative analysis of opinions from global North and South research collaborators. Figure 8 shows that the most notable impact of the lockdown is on local and international events such as meetings, workshops, or conferences. Perhaps this explains why survey participants cited the lack of face-to-face contact with colleagues\\n\\n\\\\nTable 4: Comparative analysis of the North-South research environment questionsas the most significant impact of the lockdown. This impact is not surprising because face-to-face contacts are common occurrences at pre-pandemic local and international events.\\n\\nIn addition to international and local events, the lockdown has also impacted people involved in laboratory and fieldwork. Table 5 shows that, even though a different number of people answered this question, there is no significant difference between the global North and South (mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 2.1923 (n=26), mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 2.2364 (n=55)). Table 6 summarises comments made by some of the survey participants (e.g. ID63, ID304, ID94, ID370) regarding the effect of the lockdown on laboratory and fieldwork and other research activities.\\n\\nWhen asked whether they would like to continue working from home after the lockdown, 34% of the respondents answered in the affirmative, 31% said \\\"No\\\", and 29% of them were undecided. As shown in Table 5, while the majority of the respondents are looking forward to the end of the lockdown, a sizable number (mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.6552 (n=29), mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.6885 (n=61)) of them also learnt a new set of skills or technologies during this period. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of how people from the global North and South responded to these statements revealed a significant difference. For instance, as indicated by the mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = -0.1111 and \\\\(p\\\\) = 0.004385** values in Table 5, while 67.2% of the respondents from the South felt more productive during the lockdown, their counterparts in the North felt otherwise. The reverse was true for \\\"I feel less productive\\\". A significant number (_p_ = 0.014430*) of respondents from the global South also answered \\\"Yes\\\" to \\\"Sometimes I have face-to-face meetings\\\" than their Northern counterparts. They also significantly (_p_ = 0.000025**) experienced more electricity power outage during the lockdown. The \\\"Yes\\\", \\\"No\\\" and \\\"Uncertain\\\" responses to these statsements are also illustrated in Figure 9.\\n\\nFigure 8: Effect of the pandemic on some aspects of research collaboration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\nTable 5: Comparative analysis of North-South research collaborators opinions\\n\\n\\\\nTable 6: Selected participants comments\\n\\n\\\\n\\n#### Opinions from Principal Investigators/Project Managers\\n\\nThe opinions of the 10% of the people who classified themselves as Principal Investigators/Project Managers in the demography analysis 4) is not that much different from the rest of the studied cohort. 60% of them (50% males and 50% females) come from the South whilst the other 40% are from the North. 70%) indicated that they are working from home in their own countries. 20% were working from home in another country, caught up by pandemic travel restrictions when completing the survey. The remaining 10% did not indicate their home location. Furthermore, seven out of ten had difficultyreaching out to research collaborators, making scheduling face-to-face meetings almost impossible. During the lockdown, 95% of the Investigators/Project Managers said that they have learnt a new set of skills or technology.\\n\\nWhen asked whether they would like to continue working from home after the lockdown, more than half of them said \\\"No\\\". Most of the PIs/project managers indicated that managing international and local research collaboration is either \\\"most affected\\\" or \\\"affected\\\". The group expressed that hiring new researchers, staff or student assistants is less affected by the pandemic.

We would like to sound a note of caution when generalising the findings from this study. In particular, the dataset used in this study is a small dataset and by no means representative of the entire global North and South research collaboration population or projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",
      "|  4 | The dataset only consists of 64 respondents from 14 Northern countries and 38 respondents from 19 Southern countries. We also mentioned that the country of residence data is skewed because respondents from Germany and Nigeria alone account for more than a third of all the respondents from the 33 countries (ref. Table 2).\\n\\nWhile the North-South research collaboration data collection methodology presented in Figure 1 gave us all the instruments needed to craft a good survey, the questionnaire was not able to capture some elements where the participants expressed strong opinions. For example, there is no way of knowing from the demographic data the profession of 4% of the people surveyed, the other technologies and platforms researchers are using to collaborate with their colleagues (discussed in Section 4.1), or the other forms of distractions research collaborators encounter when working from home.\\n\\n## 5 Discussion\\n\\nIrrespective of the geographical location, the status of the research collaboration infrastructure (technology and platforms used to collaborate with colleagues), and research collaboration (home) environment, many researchers managed to continue working fromhome on their research collaboration projects that started before the pandemic. A small number (10%) of the researchers are working from both home and office. But working from home does not mean that researchers are not mobile. We reported that, on average, every respondent visited at least one country (mean =1.11) during the pandemic. Some people in the global North visited two or more (max. = 4) countries.\\n\\n### North-South research collaboration infrastructure during the pandemic\\n\\nAs attested by Archibald et al. (2019), Sein (2020) and Zaer et al. (2020), the COVID-19 crisis has forced people to embrace collaboration and coordination technologies for working online and from home. Many studies, for instance, (Grasenick & Guerrero, 2020; Rogers, 2020; Zaer et al., 2020), found out that researchers are using various technologies to help them cope with the pandemic and continue their research.\\n\\nInteresting about the research collaboration infrastructure (Subsection 4.1 and Table 5) is that not only the use of some technologies increased, decreased or stayed the same during the pandemic, but the pandemic provided researchers from both the global North and South the opportunity to learn a new set of skills or technologies. All the people surveyed indicated that their use of Zoom increased during the pandemic. Despite the challenges, videoconferencing software provides opportunities to connect and discuss research progress with colleagues. As one global South collaborator, _South/ID334_, commented in Table 6, _\\\"...I can work peacefully at home...meetings in Zoom... are possible-but it is difficult to discuss all the nuances of the research project\\\"_.\\n\\nThe increase in the use of zoom and other videoconferencing technologies (WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, Skype) during the pandemic is also an increase in online meetings, which might, in turn, lead to what Rogers (2020) referred to as \\\"Zoom fatigue\\\". We cannot infer fatigue from our data, but the group studied had 44.76 online meetings using a computer, Laptop or Tablet and 14.2 online meetings using telephone or mobile. Meaning not a single working day goes by without a Zoom meeting. A paradox on the devices used for online meetings during the pandemic is that, according to the International Telecommunication Union statistics, the developing world (global South) outnumbers the developed world (global North) by 6:1 when it comes to Mobile-cellular subscriptions. However, we found out that, during the same period, researchers in the global North (e.g. Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, France, Japan) had twice as many online meetings using telephone or mobile as their counterparts in the global South (e.g. Indonesia, Costa Rica).\\n\\nThe research collaboration infrastructure with all its associated challenges provides an opportunity for researchers to address some of the most pressing research collaboration problems posed by the pandemic such as the lack of face-to-face contact with colleagues and the difficulty in reaching out to research collaborators. Consequently, as argued by Duek and Fliss (2020), research collaboration will be impacted for researchers lacking the appropriate infrastructure (e.g. affordable and stable internet access) but will be enhanced for those who can access and use collaboration technologies to \\\"talk\\\" to collaborators whilst working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nIn this study, the lack of or slow internet connection, cost of mobile data, lack of electricity and appropriate equipment such as laptop or headphone for videoconferencing is ranked high by researchers from the global South. A stark contrast was observed on how the lack of electricity (_p_ = 0.000465**), internet connection (_p_ = 0.002610**) and the cost of mobile data (_p_ = 0.000251**) is affecting researchers from the global South to engage in research collaboration while working from home. Another notable highlight of this study is the cancellation or suspension of local and international events (e.g. meetings, workshops, conferences, fieldwork) because of travel restrictions. The highlight is lucidly captured in the comments made by some of the survey respondents in Table 6. For example, respondent _South/ID63_ commented that if it were not for the pandemic, his team would have completed the fieldwork they scheduled for September 2020. Respondent _North/370_ felt sad that the workshop he organised with South African and European partners did not take place because of the lockdown. Another participant (_North/ID304_) commented that the lockdown did not allow them to visit their research site and collaborate with other researchers.\\n\\nIn addition to using videoconferencing tools to support North-South research collaboration, researchers also used several social media and research platforms to collaborate with their colleagues. We found out that ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Facebook and LinkedIn, in that order, are the most favoured platforms by researchers from both the global North and South. Cloud storage services for sharing research data are dominated by Google Drive and DropBox, with 64% of the users coming from the global North and 57.4% from the global South.\\n\\n### North-South research collaboration (home) environment during the pandemic\\n\\nTrying to stay focused while working from home has become the new normal for many people. In this study, researchers from both the North and South indicated that children and phone calls and text messaging are the most distracting when they work from home (see Table 4). Generally, we also found out that respondents from the North are less distracted by neighbours (mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 8.5536 (n=56), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 2.5220, \\\\(p\\\\) = 0.009073**) and TV and Radio (mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 8.3818 (n=55), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 2.7588, \\\\(p\\\\) = 0.009073**) than their counterparts in the South. Specifically, except for the participants from 4 countries in the global South (South Africa, Nigeria, China, Costa Rica), all other participants who gave rank 10 (less distracting) to distractions from neighbours are from the global North.\\n\\nIt was not only the case that we could not find consensus amongst the researchers when asked whether they would like to continue working from home after the lockdown (\\\"Yes\\\" = 34%, \\\"No\\\" = 31%, \\\"Undecided\\\" = 29%), but the majority of them (94%) said that they are looking forward to the end of the lockdown. Maybe the researchers in our dataset want the lockdown to end but continue working from home most of the time? In connection with this conjecture is the argument advanced by Spier and Evans (2021) that institutional shutdown and the prohibition of physical contacts has forced researchers to turn to remote research because of some of the organisational changes (teleworking). Table 5 also lists other self-esteem and environmental factors that come into play when working from home during the pandemic. For instance, more than two-thirds (67.2%) of the respondents from the global South felt more productive during the pandemic than their Northern counterparts.\\n\\n## 6 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we presented an approach, a methodology, and a framework for studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for North-South research collaboration. We approached the subject of this study by grouping a series of questions from an online survey into two main sections we called research collaboration infrastructure and research collaboration environment. The grouping helped us trim the complex nature of research collaboration to just these two manageable dimensions. The methodology shows how we planned, designed, piloted and deployed the survey data collection instrument or questionnaire. We used the analytical framework to explain how we applied an independent nonparametric _t_-test and other statistical measures to analyse the survey data we obtained from 102 researchers coming from 33 different countries.\\n\\nThe results and discussion presented helped us understand the complex nature of research collaboration projects and how the pandemic has changed the way project managers used to manager research projects prior to the pandemic. In managing a research collaboration project, the project is usually involved in several essential project management activities. The activities may include project planning and tracking, managing project resources (human and research material), estimating and calculating costs, schedule management (conference, research visits), risk and communication management. Of course, for any project, research or otherwise, delays, inefficiencies, and rising costs can occur when executing any of the above activities. In a blog post, Camelia, 2022 argued that for many organizations, including Clusters of Excellence in Universities, problems associated with remote project management are not new. She argues that a project (research or otherwise) with the right tools and clear communication and collaboration strategy can succeed. She highlighted two essential requirements for success:\\n\\n* a project with the right technical equipment (computer, internet connection, remote access to company software), and\\n* a project in which most of the members have the right technical equipment (computer, internet connection, remote access to software), and the scope of work and responsibilities are clearly defined.\\n\\nBut this is remote research project management during a pandemic where almost all research collaboration activities are remote and online. Although a small percentage (10%), the research collaboration project managers in this study learned a new set of skills or technology to help them address the challenges associated with remote research project management. An interview with one of the project managers revealed that his online presence has increased. He has learned to use various tech platforms for messaging and audio/video communication with project partners. His online interaction with project members provides him with visibility, leading to improvement in collaboration to achieve greater productivity in the project. In terms of the technical research infrastructure and home environment, there are significant differences between the global North and South.\\n\\nThus, we posit that this research can potentially add to our understanding of the nature of research collaboration and how to manage research collaboration projects involving partners from the global North and South. The empirical study can also act as a best-practice guideline or lessons learnt dossier for project management professionals and Clusters of Excellence and universities interested in pursuing or sustaining research collaboration during a pandemic. We assume that many pure online or hybrid formats will most likely continue. They provide chances for flexible research collaboration project management (e.g. scheduling meetings, workshops and conferences) and no face-to-face cooperation without the need to travel for short distances.\\n\\n### Future work\\n\\nWe plan to use the analysis framework (ref.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

      "|  0 | Managing North-South Research Collaboration Projects\\n\\nDuring the COVID-19 Pandemic. An Empirical Study\\n\\nAnonymous author(s)\\n\\n**Abstract**\\n\\nResearchers from the global North and South have collaborated for decades to conduct cutting-edge interdisciplinary research. The tools they used to manage their research projects remained virtually unchanged until the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak early in 2020. Since then, a lot has changed, including the nature and dynamics of research collaboration. How are researchers and project managers adapting to this change? Survey data, semi-structured interviews, and personal accounts from 102 respondents from 33 countries are used in this empirical study to investigate the impact of the pandemic on research collaboration projects. An independent non-parametric t-test revealed a significant difference in the research collaboration infrastructure and home environment between global North and global South collaborators. The findings have practical implications for people involved in collaborative research projects, funding agencies, project management professionals, and universities interested in pursuing or sustaining North-South research collaboration during the pandemic.\\n\\n**Keywords:** COVID-19 pandemic, Social distancing, New Normal, Global North-South, Project Management, Collaborative research projects, Clusters of Excellence, Online Survey.\\n\\n \\n\\n## 1 Introduction\\n\\nIn collaborative research, a globally distributed, sometimes co-located team of researchers work together to address research questions pertinent to their study. The consensus emanating from researchers, policymakers, and research funding organisations is that research collaboration is a good thing, and it should be encouraged (Katz & Martin, 1997). Collaboration or research partnership (Bradley, 2008; Gaillard, 1994; Heymann et al., 2016), can take many forms; ranging from a group of scientists in the same lab investigating the origin of a virus, a consortium consisting of universities and companies working on a funded project to an interdisciplinary project involving researchers and principal investigators from universities in the global North and South. Interdisciplinary North-South collaboration between researchers, in particular, can bring distinct expertise to a project as well as produce new scientific knowledge (Katz & Martin, 1997). Furthermore, as acknowledged by J. Lee and Haupt (2020), research collaboration benefits not only low-income (Southern) but also high-income (Northern) countries as well.\\n\\nThe main characteristic of North-South research collaboration is that researchers are often geographically dispersed. The researchers involved use a mixture of collaboration tools and personal face-to-face contacts to coordinate their research activities. Under normal circumstances, they can travel and meet in small groups to discuss their research in a workshop, seminar or conference. Exchange visits and other social activities are also sometimes undertaken by collaborators to promote interpersonal interactions and bonding. Researchers can also use emails, video conferencing, or social media platforms to communicate with their colleagues when the need arises.\\n\\nHowever, since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 on 30 January 2020 to be a public health emergency of international concern, many \\\"normal\\\" research collaboration activities have almost become impossible. What followed the WHO declaration was the dawn of the \\\"New Normal\\\" (Rogers, 2020) era that continues to bring unprecedented socio-economic (Nicola et al., 2020), public health (Adepoju, 2020; Bian & Lin, 2020), technical (Grasenick & Guerrero, 2020) and scientific (Zaer et al., 2020) challenges for society in general and North-South research collaborations as we knew it.\\n\\n### Motivation\\n\\nAs members of the Africa Multiple Cluster of Excellence1 at the University of Bayreuth, Germany, the authors are involved in several open collaboration research projects with partners from the global North (e.g. Europe) and global South (e.g. Africa). The research projects are parts of the Clusters of Excellence research projects funded by the German Excellence Strategy. Cluster members have a long history of interdisciplinary North-South research collaboration. The aim of the Cluster, among other things, is to develop a digital research environment for reconfiguring African Studies (Seesemann,2020). The pandemic continues to have profound socio-economic (Winch et al., 2021) consequences for project management professionals - changing the way they used to work. Like many other collaborative projects, we are also heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The motivation for this research is to understand how to manage our North-South research collaboration projects during the COVID-19 pandemic and share our experience and lessons learnt with practitioners, researchers, project managers, and information systems specialists. Project management uses specific tools and techniques to deliver a valuable product to the people or communities concerned. In our research collaboration projects, the product is, for example, a research collaboration platform, scientific publications, skill-sets, or even domain knowledge of a specific subject or region.\\n\\nTo develop a thorough understanding of project management during the pandemic means that our analysis must help us understand the challenges involved in managing the resources and outputs of the projects. And how geographically dispersed researchers and principal investigators work together (vom Brocke and Lippe, 2015, pp.10, 19). Noting that the chance of face-to-face meetings and knowledge exchanges among researchers might not be possible during the pandemic, we also need to understand the communication technologies and strategy project professionals are using to overcome geographical distance (vom Brocke and Lippe, 2015).\\n\\n### Contribution and research questions\\n\\nMany countries have implemented measures to help reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV2 virus and its OMICRON variant. Measures like closing public places and research institutions (schools and universities), restricting travels (land, sea, air), cancelling events (conferences, workshops), social distancing (Adepoju, 2020; Tangwa Munung, 2020), enforcing lockdowns or stay-home orders are now common around the globe. However, some countries are beginning to lift some of these restrictions because of public pressure (Burki, 2021).\\n\\nAlthough these measures resulted in the cancellation of some research collaboration projects and activities, others continued and adapted to the COVID-19 crisis by embracing collaboration and coordination technologies for remote work (Zaer et al., 2020), and at the same time, new projects started in Europe, the Americas, Africa, the Pacific and ASEAN regions.\\n\\nThe pandemic is not only impacting the way we conduct research locally, between universities nationally and internationally, but it has propelled North-South research collaboration to the forefront of public discourse in both the public and private sectors. Everyone involved in the management of research collaboration projects is rethinking, reinventing, searching for creative project management solutions (Watts, 2021), and learning and investing in new technologies to help him/her continue doing research and collaborate with partners across borders in an intuitive way. Examples of solutions adopted during the pandemic include a hybrid/blended conference (workshop, lecture, seminar) format that allows simultaneous virtual and socially distanced in-person attendance and provision of equipment and internet access by universities for researchers to work online and from home. Furthermore, Zaer et al. (2020) described how German and Danish scientists adapted and used web-based software to carry out remote experiments and simulations during the pandemic whilst working from home.\\n\\nA review of the literature on managing research collaboration during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that many studies emphasised the importance of research collaboration in general (Bian and Lin, 2020; J. Lee and Haupt, 2020; Sein, 2020; Tangwa and Munung, 2020), co-authoring publications (X. Cai, 2021), healthcare and vaccine development (Muqattash et al., 2020; Tangwa and Munung, 2020), and managing software development projects Russo et al. (2021), project management case study (Wahbi et al., 2020), to mention a few. Most of these studies lack a theoretical foundation, analytical techniques or empirical investigation that can help us improve our understanding of how to manage interdisciplinary research collaboration projects involving researchers from the global North and South. Thus, best practices and lessons learnt to support interdisciplinary North-South research collaboration project management during the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking in the literature.\\n\\nNorth-South research collaboration projects are complex entities involving people working in different places. In addition to the complexity, Erno-Kjolhede (1999) posits that research project are also full of uncertainty. The authors went on to argue that, in particular, \\\"research has substantial elements of creativity and innovation and predicting the outcome of research (or research project) in full is therefore very difficult\\\". Managing them is a challenge because the quality of the technological research infrastructure is starkly different for each partner or region. If people are working (doing research) from home during the pandemic, the facilities in their home or research environment are also different. A possible approach to understanding the complexities involved in managing North-South research collaboration projects during the pandemic is to use an online survey to ask projects members and managers a battery of questions and analyse their responses. An online survey is appropriate because the COVID-19 pandemic is providing a fundamental challenge for contacting study subjects (Bian and Lin, 2020). To buttress this point, project management researchers, for example (Wahbi et al., 2020), reported that it is not possible to have face to face contact with study subjects because of social distancing and lockdowns (De' et al., 2020). Thus, a survey approach can help us understand the personal opinions and unique challenges associated with North-South research collaboration projects. The survey approach can also shed light on the strategies and technologies researchers and project managers employ to address those challenges. Therefore, this study attempts to answer a series of research questions broadly grouped into the two major sections described below:\\n\\n1. Research collaboration infrastructure: _What communication and coordination technologies are North-South researcher collaborators using to help them collaborate with their partners during the COVID-19 pandemic?_ Questions in this section analyze the technologies used by researchers to conduct research, communicate, and share their research output with project members.\\n\\nThe challenges research collaborators (researchers and project managers) face in using the technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.\\n2. Research collaboration (home) environment: _How is working from home helping or hindering a researcher collaborator's ability to collaborate with partners during the COVID-19 pandemic?_ Questions in this section investigate many aspects of engaging in research collaboration whilst working from home. For example, how working from home affects the mobility of the researchers, the distractions they face, internet connectivity problems, etc.\\n\\nThe two sections and questions are part of an online survey questionnaire targeting global North and South researchers and project managers. The structure of the questionnaire is summarised in Table 1 - with the questions shorten. The full survey structure and questions is available at [https://tinyurl.com/y3rcukkk](https://tinyurl.com/y3rcukkk). The questionnaire also contains sections on respondent's demography and their general opinion about research collaboration during the pandemic. The online survey ran for about 3.5 months (January 15 - April 30, 2021).\\n\\n\\ |\n",

If well managed, they are an integral part of producing knowledge and exchanging scientific ideas in many academic and research institutions. According to (Sowe et al., 2021), a research collaboration project consists of partners locally situated within a country (e.g. Germany or Nigeria), region (e.g. Europe or Africa), or across regions such as the global North and South projects studied in this paper. Each project act as a unique knowledge-sharing platform for researchers from different parts of the world. Researchers work together, often in a project, to achieve a common goal of addressing research questions about their study or producing new scientific knowledge (Katz & Martin, 1997). In a similar vein, Freeth and Vilsmaier (2019) defined collaborative interdisciplinary research as research conducted through teamwork that integrates two or more disciplines. Some researchers, for example, Heymann et al. (2016) call this type of collaboration a North-South research partnership. Others take a socio-economic dimension and argue that the North-South dichotomy categorises nations as either being rich, developed countries or poorer developing countries in need of assistance (Kindiki et al., 2019).\\n\\nThe motivation for managing and/or taking part in a research collaboration project can be either intrinsic or extrinsic, a mixture of both. Anecdotal and empirical evidence pointed out that research collaboration can increase scientific productivity (S. Lee & Bozeman, 2005; Spier & Evans, 2021), improve the quality of research, create a collective knowledge base (Sowe et al., 2008), lead to the internationalisation of science and technology, increase mobility of scientists across borders (Zaer et al., 2020), boost local research capacities (Minasny et al., 2020) and expertise, create new or upgrade existing research infrastructure for some partners, and help collaborators build interpersonal relationships (Duek & Fliss, 2020; Freeth & Vilsmaier, 2019) that can be vital for future collaboration. Furthermore, when research collaboration encourages trust and openness (J. Lee & Haupt, 2020) between partners and institutions, it can become an essential tool for supporting interdisciplinary research in the humanities (Maina-Ahlberg et al., 1997), brain science (Grasenick & Guerrero, 2020), health (Bian & Lin, 2020), education (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; The Lancet, 2020), environmental (Porter & Birdi, 2018) and medical sciences (Mummery, 2020), engineering (Sowe et al., 2008), or foster academia-industry collaboration (Marijan & Gotlieb, 2020).\\n\\nShenhar and Dvir (2007) pointed out that most projects fail and many projects do not accomplish their desired results. Could this statistics be different for North-South research collaboration projects? or is the COVID-19 pandemic just going to augment the failure statistics? Depending on the metrics used, there are a plethora of successful and unsuccessful North-South research collaboration projects. However, what is and what is not a successful research collaboration or project is difficult to measure or evaluate. Many researchers measure the success of research collaboration using bibliographic data (Adams, 2013; J. Lee & Haupt, 2020). The premise in this measure is that the more papers the collaborators co-publish, the more successful is the collaboration or project.\\n\\nSowe et al. (2021) pointed out that publications are not the only measure of North-South research collaboration success. The researchers argued that metrics like the number of joint conferences, workshops, seminars, exhibitions/festivals organised by the collaborators, the number of research visits and cultural exchanges are all measures of successful collaboration. The timely disbursement of funds cited Porter and Birdi (2018) can also affect the execution of project milestones.\\n\\nSocio-cultural misunderstanding, conflicting ideas or approaches to a topic, individual researcher's competence (Maina-Ahlberg et al., 1997), can all be barriers to successful international research collaboration, especially between researchers in the global North and South. Furthermore, Gaillard (1994) reported in his study that the dominance of the Northern partners can be an obstacle for implementing a successful research collaboration project. This dominance or imbalance is synonymous with what Minasny et al. (2020) called \\\"Helicopter research\\\". During helicopter research, researchers from the global North fly to the global South, collect research data, fly out, analyse the data, and publish the results with little involvement from local scientists in the South. Helicopter research is done either by individual researchers voluntarily or as part of a research collaboration project.\\n\\nThe mobility restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect this is having on conventional work practices (Sein, 2020) means that research collaboration is only effectively possible because of collaboration and coordination technologies and the fact that researchers can work online and from home (Sowe et al., 2021). Many studies found out that researchers are using various technologies to help them cope with the pandemic and continue their research (Grasenick and Guerrero, 2020; Rogers, 2020; Zaer et al., 2020). For project managers in general, Watts (2021) observed that the New Normal (Rogers, 2020) is characterised by online video meetings, document sharing, the use of messaging platforms, and non-stop Zoom calls.\\n\\n### Research collaboration during the pandemic\\n\\nApart from ushering in new communication and collaboration challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic also provides a unique opportunity for researchers to understand the dynamics of research collaboration projects and engage with research collaborators in new ways. For instance, J. Lee and Haupt, 2020 report that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, countries with lower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) tend to participate more in open-access scientific publications than their counterpart in countries with higher GDP. The Mawazo Institute Survey Report, (Mawazo, 2020), found out that 72.5% of respondents suspended their lab research because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Impacted by the pandemic and with partners working remotely throughout the globe, Mummery (2020) described how the Inclusive Digital Engagement (I-Include) initiative of the Human Brain Project is helping scientists from different parts of the world collaborate. Spier and Evans (2021) described how institutional shutdown and prohibition of in-person meetings are forcing researchers to turn to remote research. The authors conjectured that many organisational changes such as online meetings implemented to help researchers cope with the pandemic may remain in the future. Zaer et al. (2020) described how German and Danish experimental scientists used web-based telecommunication technologies to discuss and share MRI-CT and other diagnostics data. Furthermore, in responding to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Labour Organization launched the South-South and Triangular Cooperation initiative targeting 75 countries in the global South. One of the major prerequisites that project applicants must satisfy is the provision of knowledge exchange and a virtual meeting platform.\\n\\nThus, researchers from both the global North and South who can access and use the internet and collaboration technologies to remotely \\\"talk\\\" to collaborators whilst working from home are immensely advantaged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, research collaboration will be impacted for researchers lacking affordable and stable internet access at home, especially in the global South (Duek and Fliss, 2020).\\n\\n## 3 Methodology\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the methodology we used to collect the data needed to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for North-South research collaboration projects. Nieto et al. (2020) and Muqattash et al. (2020) used a similar survey instrument to collect data during the pandemic. The methodology is divided into three stages.\\n\\n1. **Preparation**: During the preparatory stage, we carried out a series of brainstorming sessions to discuss the types of questions to ask, under what sections the questions should appear, and the logic needed to redirect respo\\n\\nFigure 1: North-South research collaboration projects data collection methodology.\\n\\nof sketches, we designed the survey questionnaire using LimeSurvey (LimeSurvey Development Team, 2020). The questionnaire was then tested and piloted with a small group of researchers, principal investigators and research projects managers. After addressing the feedback from the pilot group, we modified and deployed the survey online. Some of the feedback included removing the mandatory option for some of the questions. The finalised questionnaire contained 25 questions spread across four sections presented in Table 1.\\n2. **Deployment**: The survey was freely hosted by [https://survey-consulting.com](https://survey-consulting.com), founded by Dr. Marcel Minke. The survey was in open-access mode, which means that participants can freely access the survey by clicking the link we sent them. Snowballing technique (Muqattash et al., 2020) was used to ask potential respondents to send the survey link to their colleagues who may be interested in the survey topic. One advantage of this technique is the multiplier effect - allowing the person who receives the survey link to nominate two or more others. Participation in the survey was not mandatory but based on availability and willingness to take part. We announced the survey on various mailing lists, social media channels and selected research networks. During the follow-ups, participants were contacted via Zoom, Microsoft teams, and WhatsApp to discuss their responses.\\n3. **Data, Pre-processing and Analysis**: The survey data was downloaded from the Limesurvey MySQL database and exported as CSV for analysis using the R statistical and Data Analysis software (R Core Team, 2020). Data preprocessing included converting questions into coded variables and removing incomplete answers that do not contain the information needed to answer the research questions.\\n\\n## 4 Results and Analysis\\n\\nFigure 2 shows our analysis framework. As sketched, we used various qualitative and quantitative metrics to analyse responses to the questions in the questionnaire. The analysis begins with a description of the demographic characteristics of the respondents. The research collaboration infrastructure and the research collaboration (home) environment sections are then analysed and used to answer the research questions (stated in Subsection 1.2). The analysis proceeds with an exposition of respondents opinions about research collaboration during the pandemic. Information obtained during the semi-structured follow-up interviews (Figure 1) is also analysed and used to enrich the analysis.\\n\\n### Data Set\\n\\nThe survey was activated online on January 15, 2021. After 3.5 months, on April 30, 2021, we collected 1320 responses (100 full + 1220 partial responses). A partial response was created in the survey database whenever someone clicks the survey link and closes the window without completing the survey. A partial response can also contain data for one or more answered questions. A full response was recorded in the database whenever someone completes the mandatory questions and clicks the _Submit Survey_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

The mean number of respondents per country is 3.09 (Median = 2.00, Std. Deviation = 5.192). However, the country of residence data is skewed (Skewness = 4.672, Kurtosis = 24.002) because respondents from Germany and Nigeria alone account for more than a third (38%) of all the respondents from the 33 countries. The global North-South distribution of the countries according to the Wikimedia 2021 regional classification of countries is shown in Table 2.\\n\\n\\\\nTable 2: Global distribution of the respondents\\n\\nFigure 2: Framework for analysing research collaboration projects during the pandemic.\\n\\nIn terms of age, most of the respondents (30%) are in the 35-44 years age range. Nobody was 75 years and older. The percentage of respondents in the other age ranges are as follows: 18-24 years = 1%, 25-34 years = 17%, 45-54 years = 28%, 55-64 years = 19%, and 65-74 years = 5%. The gender distribution was 54% male and 42% female. As shown in Figure 3, nearly half of the respondents are researchers (43%), followed by 35% of the respondents who categorise themselves as university professors. Teachers and lecturers (22%) and doctoral and postdoctoral candidates (17%) are the 3\\\\({}^{rd}\\\\) and 4\\\\({}^{th}\\\\) largest professions. 4% indicated that they belong to another profession not captured by the survey. Principal investigators (PIs) and research collaboration project managers account for 10% of the population studied.\\n\\nWhen asked about their research area or field of study, more than a half (53%) of the respondents indicated that they are specialising in the Social Sciences and Humanities and 16% indicated that they are specialising in Computer Science and Information Technology. 4% of the respondents are specialising in each of the following fields: Business and Management, Education, Media and Communications, and Environmental, Agricultural, and Physical Sciences. 60% of the respondents work in the public sector, 9% in the private sector, 5% in the nonprofit sector, and over three-quarters are affiliated with a Cluster of Excellence. The Clusters of Excellence are funded by the Germany's Excellence Strategy (DFG). With the latter affiliation, about 72% of the respondents are working in Clusters of Excellence located in the global North while the remaining participants (19.4%) are working in Clusters of Excellence located in the global South.\\n\\nFurthermore, Figure 4 shows that 80% of the respondents were already involved in a research project when the survey was administered. 37.5% (N = 57) reported that their research project started before the pandemic and funding is continuing for 17.8% of them. However, for those with projects running during the pandemic, 15.5% reported that some project activities (e.g. meetings, conferences, workshops, field trips) were not funded. While 17.8% were able to acquire funding for new research projects, 8.6% had\\n\\nFigure 3: Demographic characteristics of the participants by profession.\\n\\ntheir projects put on hold or discontinued (3.9%) during the pandemic. When asked about where (global North or South) the majority of their projects partners are located, about 40% indicated that their partners are in the global South (e.g. Africa), more than a third (35.06%) indicated that their partners are in the global North (e.g. Western Europe), and 19% indicated that their partners are equally distributed between the global North and South.\\n\\nIn the following subsections 4.1 and 4.2 we summarise and analyse the research questions. To emphasise the differences between responses from the global North and the global South, we use an independent non-parametric _t_-test where we group respondents based on their answer to the question, \\\"Where do you work?\\\". We chose the workplace grouping as the demographic data shows that 60% of the respondents work in the public sector, and over three-quarters are affiliated with a Cluster of Excellence (\\\\(>\\\\) 70% in the global North and \\\\(>\\\\) 20 in the global South). For all the results subsequently analysed, we aggregated responses to each of the items based on the classification of the workplaces and applied the _t_-test to the two groups. The Tables 3-5 depict the mean values together with the standard deviation for both groups. The result of the _t_-test is also given in the form of a p-value. Significant differences are highlighted with an asterisk (*) for a level of \\\\(p<0.5\\\\) and two asterisks (**) for a p-value of \\\\(p<0.01\\\\). For the items, we used different question types often with individual scales. The survey contained simple Yes/No-questions, as well as Likert-scaled questions with either 3 or 10 choices. To support understandability of the results listed in the Tables 3-5, we mentioned the scale at the beginning of each question explaining the meaning of the corresponding numbers.\\n\\nIn the survey, participants indicated that their use of Zoom, WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex, and Skype has significantly (\\\\(p<0.05\\\\), 2-tailed) increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other technologies not included in the survey also registered an increase in use during the pandemic. For example, as indicated by _respondent ID108 from the global South_, WeChat is another research collaboration platform commonly used in China. However, as shown in Figure 5 and Table 3, there is significance difference in the way North-South research collaborators use WhatsApp (\\\\(p=0.000103\\\\)**), Skype (\\\\(p=0.000268\\\\)**), and Google Meet, previously called Google Hangouts Meet (\\\\(p=0.013286\\\\)*).

Dev. = 32.38) and 14.2 online meetings (N = 90, Std. Dev. = 17.36) using telephone or mobile. During these online meetings, users encountered numerous challenges (Figure 6). For instance, 19% of the people surveyed reported low bandwidth and insufficient internet connection problems. In addition, audio and video quality problems were reported by 18% and 16% of the respondents, respectively. There are no significant differences (_p_ = 0.407634) in these challenges between the global South (\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\)) and North (\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\)) groups.\\n\\nAlthough respondents from the two groups answered differently. For example, for the internet connection and insufficient internet bandwidth problem, the values were mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.6176 (n=34), std\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.4933 and mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.5303 (n=66), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.5029. When asked to indicate the platforms they are using to collaborate with their colleague, most of the respondents chose other collaboration platforms not represented in the survey. However, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Facebook and LinkedIn are also popular platforms among respondents. As shown in Table 3, the cloud storage services for sharing research data is dominated by Google Drive (mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.7647 (n=34), std\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.4306 and mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.5303 (n=66), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.5029) and there is a significant difference (_p_ = 0.017324*) in the use of this service by research collaborators in the North and South. DropBox is the second preferred cloud storage for sharing research data (mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.4412 (n=34), std\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.5040 and mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.5758 (n=66), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.4980). Non of the respondents selected LiveDrive and Zoolz, but other cloud storage services (mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.2353 (n=34), std\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.4306 and mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.3788 (n=66), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.4888) are also commonly used by the collaborators.\\n\\nFigure 6: Problems encountered by research collaborators during online meetings.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Research collaboration (home) environment\\n\\n_How is working from home helping or hindering a researcher collaborator's ability to collaborate with partners during the COVID-19 pandemic?_\\n\\nMany people are slowly getting used to working from home during the pandemic. 85% of the people surveyed answered the \\\"Are you working from home?\\\" question in the affirmative. 10% are working from home but sometimes go to their offices to work on their research projects. The average number of countries visited by the respondents was 1.11 (Std. Dev. = 0.89), and the maximum number of countries visited by one individual from the global North was 4.\\n\\nWhen asked to rank the factors affecting their ability to work from home, participants from both the global North and South reported that the most significant effect (of the lockdown) is the lack of direct face-to-face contact with colleagues (Figure 7 and Table 4). Researchers also have difficulty in contacting research partners and scheduling meetings when working from home.\\n\\nFurthermore, when asked to rank what distracts them most when working from home, most people reported that children are the most distracting. Distractions from phone calls and messaging and other forms of distractions not captured in the survey also rank high amongst the respondents. Table 4 shows that there is a significant difference between the way people from the global South and global North ranked distractions from neighbours (_p_ = 0.001066**) and TV and Radio (_p_ = 0.009073**).\\n\\nFigure 7: Factors affecting research collaboration when working from home.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Opinions: Research collaboration during the pandemic\\n\\nTable 5 represents a comparative analysis of opinions from global North and South research collaborators. Figure 8 shows that the most notable impact of the lockdown is on local and international events such as meetings, workshops, or conferences. Perhaps this explains why survey participants cited the lack of face-to-face contact with colleagues\\n\\n\\\\nTable 4: Comparative analysis of the North-South research environment questionsas the most significant impact of the lockdown. This impact is not surprising because face-to-face contacts are common occurrences at pre-pandemic local and international events.\\n\\nIn addition to international and local events, the lockdown has also impacted people involved in laboratory and fieldwork. Table 5 shows that, even though a different number of people answered this question, there is no significant difference between the global North and South (mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 2.1923 (n=26), mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 2.2364 (n=55)). Table 6 summarises comments made by some of the survey participants (e.g. ID63, ID304, ID94, ID370) regarding the effect of the lockdown on laboratory and fieldwork and other research activities.\\n\\nWhen asked whether they would like to continue working from home after the lockdown, 34% of the respondents answered in the affirmative, 31% said \\\"No\\\", and 29% of them were undecided. As shown in Table 5, while the majority of the respondents are looking forward to the end of the lockdown, a sizable number (mean\\\\({}_{gS}\\\\) = 0.6552 (n=29), mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 0.6885 (n=61)) of them also learnt a new set of skills or technologies during this period. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of how people from the global North and South responded to these statements revealed a significant difference. For instance, as indicated by the mean\\\\({}

The reverse was true for \\\"I feel less productive\\\".

The remaining 10% did not indicate their home location. Furthermore, seven out of ten had difficultyreaching out to research collaborators, making scheduling face-to-face meetings almost impossible. During the lockdown, 95% of the Investigators/Project Managers said that they have learnt a new set of skills or technology.\\n\\nWhen asked whether they would like to continue working from home after the lockdown, more than half of them said \\\"No\\\". Most of the PIs/project managers indicated that managing international and local research collaboration is either \\\"most affected\\\" or \\\"affected\\\". The group expressed that hiring new researchers, staff or student assistants is less affected by the pandemic. Table 7 shows some comments the Principal Investigators/Project Managers made about how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting their research collaboration projects.\\n\\n\\\\nTable 7: Comments from Principal Investigators/Project Managers\\n\\nFigure 9: Which of the following statements applies to “you” during the lockdown.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Limitations and threats to the validity of the study\\n\\nA dataset consisting of 102 participants spread across 33 countries was used to help us understand the nature of North-South research collaboration during the COVID-19 pandemic. We would like to sound a note of caution when generalising the findings from this study. In particular, the dataset used in this study is a small dataset and by no means representative of the entire global North and South research collaboration population or projects. The dataset only consists of 64 respondents from 14 Northern countries and 38 respondents from 19 Southern countries. We also mentioned that the country of residence data is skewed because respondents from Germany and Nigeria alone account for more than a third of all the respondents from the 33 countries (ref. Table 2).\\n\\nWhile the North-South research collaboration data collection methodology presented in Figure 1 gave us all the instruments needed to craft a good survey, the questionnaire was not able to capture some elements where the participants expressed strong opinions. For example, there is no way of knowing from the demographic data the profession of 4% of the people surveyed, the other technologies and platforms researchers are using to collaborate with their colleagues (discussed in Section 4.1), or the other forms of distractions research collaborators encounter when working from home.\\n\\n## 5 Discussion\\n\\nIrrespective of the geographical location, the status of the research collaboration infrastructure (technology and platforms used to collaborate with colleagues), and research collaboration (home) environment, many researchers managed to continue working fromhome on their research collaboration projects that started before the pandemic. A small number (10%) of the researchers are working from both home and office. But working from home does not mean that researchers are not mobile. We reported that, on average, every respondent visited at least one country (mean =1.11) during the pandemic. Some people in the global North visited two or more (max. = 4) countries.\\n\\n### North-South research collaboration infrastructure during the pandemic\\n\\nAs attested by Archibald et al. (2019), Sein (2020) and Zaer et al. (2020), the COVID-19 crisis has forced people to embrace collaboration and coordination technologies for working online and from home. Many studies, for instance, (Grasenick & Guerrero, 2020; Rogers, 2020; Zaer et al., 2020), found out that researchers are using various technologies to help them cope with the pandemic and continue their research.\\n\\nInteresting about the research collaboration infrastructure (Subsection 4.1 and Table 5) is that not only the use of some technologies increased, decreased or stayed the same during the pandemic, but the pandemic provided researchers from both the global North and South the opportunity to learn a new set of skills or technologies. All the people surveyed indicated that their use of Zoom increased during the pandemic. Despite the challenges, videoconferencing software provides opportunities to connect and discuss research progress with colleagues. As one global South collaborator, _South/ID334_, commented in Table 6, _\\\"...I can work peacefully at home...meetings in Zoom... are possible-but it is difficult to discuss all the nuances of the research project\\\"_.\\n\\nThe increase in the use of zoom and other videoconferencing technologies (WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, Skype) during the pandemic is also an increase in online meetings, which might, in turn, lead to what Rogers (2020) referred to as \\\"Zoom fatigue\\\". We cannot infer fatigue from our data, but the group studied had 44.76 online meetings using a computer, Laptop or Tablet and 14.2 online meetings using telephone or mobile. Meaning not a single working day goes by without a Zoom meeting. A paradox on the devices used for online meetings during the pandemic is that, according to the International Telecommunication Union statistics, the developing world (global South) outnumbers the developed world (global North) by 6:1 when it comes to Mobile-cellular subscriptions. However, we found out that, during the same period, researchers in the global North (e.g. Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, France, Japan) had twice as many online meetings using telephone or mobile as their counterparts in the global South (e.g. Indonesia, Costa Rica).\\n\\nThe research collaboration infrastructure with all its associated challenges provides an opportunity for researchers to address some of the most pressing research collaboration problems posed by the pandemic such as the lack of face-to-face contact with colleagues and the difficulty in reaching out to research collaborators. Consequently, as argued by Duek and Fliss (2020), research collaboration will be impacted for researchers lacking the appropriate infrastructure (e.g. affordable and stable internet access) but will be enhanced for those who can access and use collaboration technologies to \\\"talk\\\" to collaborators whilst working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nIn this study, the lack of or slow internet connection, cost of mobile data, lack of electricity and appropriate equipment such as laptop or headphone for videoconferencing is ranked high by researchers from the global South. A stark contrast was observed on how the lack of electricity (_p_ = 0.000465**), internet connection (_p_ = 0.002610**) and the cost of mobile data (_p_ = 0.000251**) is affecting researchers from the global South to engage in research collaboration while working from home. Another notable highlight of this study is the cancellation or suspension of local and international events (e.g. meetings, workshops, conferences, fieldwork) because of travel restrictions. The highlight is lucidly captured in the comments made by some of the survey respondents in Table 6. For example, respondent _South/ID63_ commented that if it were not for the pandemic, his team would have completed the fieldwork they scheduled for September 2020. Respondent _North/370_ felt sad that the workshop he organised with South African and European partners did not take place because of the lockdown. Another participant (_North/ID304_) commented that the lockdown did not allow them to visit their research site and collaborate with other researchers.\\n\\nIn addition to using videoconferencing tools to support North-South research collaboration, researchers also used several social media and research platforms to collaborate with their colleagues. We found out that ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Facebook and LinkedIn, in that order, are the most favoured platforms by researchers from both the global North and South. Cloud storage services for sharing research data are dominated by Google Drive and DropBox, with 64% of the users coming from the global North and 57.4% from the global South.\\n\\n### North-South research collaboration (home) environment during the pandemic\\n\\nTrying to stay focused while working from home has become the new normal for many people. In this study, researchers from both the North and South indicated that children and phone calls and text messaging are the most distracting when they work from home (see Table 4). Generally, we also found out that respondents from the North are less distracted by neighbours (mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 8.5536 (n=56), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 2.5220, \\\\(p\\\\) = 0.009073**) and TV and Radio (mean\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 8.3818 (n=55), std\\\\({}_{gN}\\\\) = 2.7588, \\\\(p\\\\) = 0.009073**) than their counterparts in the South. Specifically, except for the participants from 4 countries in the global South (South Africa, Nigeria, China, Costa Rica), all other participants who gave rank 10 (less distracting) to distractions from neighbours are from the global North.\\n\\nIt was not only the case that we could not find consensus amongst the researchers when asked whether they would like to continue working from home after the lockdown (\\\"Yes\\\" = 34%, \\\"No\\\" = 31%, \\\"Undecided\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",
      "|  5 | \" = 29%), but the majority of them (94%) said that they are looking forward to the end of the lockdown. Maybe the researchers in our dataset want the lockdown to end but continue working from home most of the time? In connection with this conjecture is the argument advanced by Spier and Evans (2021) that institutional shutdown and the prohibition of physical contacts has forced researchers to turn to remote research because of some of the organisational changes (teleworking). Table 5 also lists other self-esteem and environmental factors that come into play when working from home during the pandemic. For instance, more than two-thirds (67.2%) of the respondents from the global South felt more productive during the pandemic than their Northern counterparts.\\n\\n## 6 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we presented an approach, a methodology, and a framework for studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for North-South research collaboration. We approached the subject of this study by grouping a series of questions from an online survey into two main sections we called research collaboration infrastructure and research collaboration environment. The grouping helped us trim the complex nature of research collaboration to just these two manageable dimensions. The methodology shows how we planned, designed, piloted and deployed the survey data collection instrument or questionnaire. We used the analytical framework to explain how we applied an independent nonparametric _t_-test and other statistical measures to analyse the survey data we obtained from 102 researchers coming from 33 different countries.\\n\\nThe results and discussion presented helped us understand the complex nature of research collaboration projects and how the pandemic has changed the way project managers used to manager research projects prior to the pandemic. In managing a research collaboration project, the project is usually involved in several essential project management activities. The activities may include project planning and tracking, managing project resources (human and research material), estimating and calculating costs, schedule management (conference, research visits), risk and communication management. Of course, for any project, research or otherwise, delays, inefficiencies, and rising costs can occur when executing any of the above activities. In a blog post, Camelia, 2022 argued that for many organizations, including Clusters of Excellence in Universities, problems associated with remote project management are not new. She argues that a project (research or otherwise) with the right tools and clear communication and collaboration strategy can succeed. She highlighted two essential requirements for success:\\n\\n* a project with the right technical equipment (computer, internet connection, remote access to company software), and\\n* a project in which most of the members have the right technical equipment (computer, internet connection, remote access to software), and the scope of work and responsibilities are clearly defined.\\n\\nBut this is remote research project management during a pandemic where almost all research collaboration activities are remote and online. Although a small percentage (10%), the research collaboration project managers in this study learned a new set of skills or technology to help them address the challenges associated with remote research project management. An interview with one of the project managers revealed that his online presence has increased. He has learned to use various tech platforms for messaging and audio/video communication with project partners. His online interaction with project members provides him with visibility, leading to improvement in collaboration to achieve greater productivity in the project. In terms of the technical research infrastructure and home environment, there are significant differences between the global North and South.\\n\\nThus, we posit that this research can potentially add to our understanding of the nature of research collaboration and how to manage research collaboration projects involving partners from the global North and South. The empirical study can also act as a best-practice guideline or lessons learnt dossier for project management professionals and Clusters of Excellence and universities interested in pursuing or sustaining research collaboration during a pandemic. We assume that many pure online or hybrid formats will most likely continue. They provide chances for flexible research collaboration project management (e.g. scheduling meetings, workshops and conferences) and no face-to-face cooperation without the need to travel for short distances.\\n\\n### Future work\\n\\nWe plan to use the analysis framework (ref. Figure 2) and a modified version of the current survey ([https://tinyurl.com/y3rcukkk](https://tinyurl.com/y3rcukkk)) to investigate post-pandemic North-South research collaboration projects. We posit this will give us more insight into the tools and techniques researchers and project managers used to cope with the pandemic. Besides, as discussed in the research methodology (ref. Figure 1), we are planning to conduct more semi-structured interviews with the 10% of the survey respondents who classified themselves as principal investigators/project managers.\\n\\n## 7
