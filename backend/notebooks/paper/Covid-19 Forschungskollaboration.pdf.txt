for many processes that would normally maintain precise characteristics, intrinsically resistant to change. The rapid spread of the virus, declared pandemic on 11 March 2020,1 forced scientists to pool their efforts for understanding the pathology and quickly put in place all possible actions against the global crisis. As noted by Colavizza (2021), "Covid-19 is having a dramatic impact on research and researchers. The pandemic has underlined the severity of already known challenges in research and surfaced new ones, but also accelerated the adoption of innovations and manifested new opportunities."

Footnote 1: [https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020](https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020), last accessed 10 June 2022.

Accompanying the scientists directly involved in Covid-19 research (biologists, clinical doctors, virologists, epidemiologists, etc.), a successive phase brought those who, using meta-analysis, sought to understand how entire research systems have responded to the crisis. A substantial share of scholars have engaged in meta-research on Covid-19 and its impacts on the research agenda of the global scientific community. The phenomena of greatest attention have concerned the evolution of Covid-19 research along temporal, spatial and thematic dimensions (Li et al., 2021; Muller et al., 2020; Pal, 2021; Vasconcelos et al., 2021), but also a discontinuity in more general scientific publishing (Sloane and Zimmerman, 2021). Some studies have observed a clear change towards the use of open access for provision of immediate access to new knowledge on Covid-19 (Belli et al., 2020). Callaway (2020) commented on the increased propensity to share preliminary results in preprints, hypothesising that the crisis may have induced permanent behavioural changes. This would also come with side effects, labelled by Pai (2020) as the "covidization of research": summarized as the proliferation of works of dubious quality, and retractions of published research, deriving from lowered scientific standards in editorial systems and sudden refocusing of entire research fields. Ioannidis et al. (2021) have voiced similar concerns, commenting in particular on the increasing interdisciplinarity in agendas, with risk of the scientists then operating in Covid-19 research without the base expertise for needs analysis and effective fight against the pandemic.

A question of great interest is how the pandemic has impacted the organisation of research work, particularly research collaborations and above all those at the international level. Sohrabi et al. (2021) illustrate that, globally, the scientific community has responded through increasing engagement between research groups in different countries, drawing on telecommunications platforms.

Cai et al. (2021) detect anomalies in the patterns of international collaboration, developing after the first few months of the pandemic era. Following the first wave, the collaborations especially involved the largest and most affected countries (China and the USA), plus others with significant research capacity (UK). Looking at their early production, Fry, Cai, Zhang, and Wagner (2020) investigated collaboration between research groups in China and the USA. They found that the two nations had centred the global Covid-19 research network, but bringing in fewer countries than the coronavirus network of pre-Covid-19 times. Thavorn et al. (2021) also found the United States and China at the centre of the global network, while Lee and Haupt (2021) remarked on the sudden increase in collaboration between the two countries despite intensification of their geo-political tensions.

Many authors note the still more pronounced resort to international collaboration in countries most affected by the crisis or with relatively low GDP. Duan and Xia (2021), through network analysis, confirm the sudden growth of international collaborations but also illustrate a centre-periphery structure of networks researching Covid-19, with increasing participation of "minor" countries, although these remain peripheral to leading "big players". Interesting, on this topic, are Cunningham, Smyth and Greene (2021), who observe a significant reduction in the size of Covid-19 research teams compared to those engaging on previous forms of coronavirus, and an equally evident increase in multidisciplinary participation. The reduction in the size of research teams is also attested in the work of Fry et al., (2020).

The health of any scientific discipline depends on continual re-evaluation of the state of the art. This is even more essential for the meta-analysis currently begun on Covid-19, still based mainly on preprints and therefore on a highly fluid and dynamic literature. Apart from this, we can quite clearly observe a lack of investigation and knowledge on what has happened to research in general, i.e. on non-covid subjects. Has the pandemic changed, for example, the intensity and propensity for international collaborations, somehow even the organisation of entire national research networks?

Collaboration is certainly and always a harbinger of great opportunities. The scientific environment is the same as that for other human activities, in the sense of requiring work in cooperation, deriving from the fact that in general the individual scientist cannot possess all the competencies and resources required for the resolution of problems. Accentuating this is the fact that the scientific challenges become ever more complex, interdisciplinary in character, and costly (Defazio et al., 2009). If the necessary competencies are not present or do not reach the critical mass within an organization, the pursuit of research requires collaborative agreements with third parties and thus leads to shared research results (Katz & Martin, 1997). The choice of collaboration form depends, among others, on the size and interdisciplinary nature of each individual project (Bennett & Gadlin, 2012; Persson et al., 1997). Collaborative research satisfies the requisites of complexity and interdisciplinarity, which are particularly strong for certain themes. Collaboration involving individuals of different competencies, cultures and previous experiences can also increase group creativity (He et al., 2009). Several studies have demonstrated that research collaborations have a positive correlation with scientific performance (Abramo et al., 2009; Dundar & Lewis, 1998; Lee & Bozeman, 2005), particularly collaborations at the international level (Van Raan, 1998; Martin-Sempere et al., 2002; Barjak & Robinson, 2008; Schmoch & Schubert, 2008; Abramo et al., 2011).

Collaboration implies transaction costs, known to be inversely proportional to the "institutional and geographic proximity" of their members (Landry & Amara, 1998). For scientists of all nations, the enforcement of long lockdowns and other operational measures have certainly impacted on work organisation, including on transaction costs of the collaborative frameworks surviving from pre-Covid times. From all this, what has resulted? Due to limits on mobility, to lockdowns and lockouts from labs, and to shifts in times and places of work, it can be expected a reduction of international and to a lesser extent of extramural national collaborations. Alongside, more intramural collaboration can be expected, especially for large-sized organizations.

With this work we aim to shed more light on the possible effects of the Covid-19 crisis on the collaboration behaviour of scientists in general, in particular on the dimensions of: the intensity of their production through participation in research teams; the size of the teams formed; the propensity of the scientists to engage in intramural, extramural national, and international collaborations; the variation of these dimensions by continent and country; the variation of these behaviours over time, from prior to during the first eight months of the declared Covid-19 crisis.

We observe the phenomena of interest with a completely new approach: taking the individual researcher as the direct unit of observation, rather than indirectly observing through their publications, and from these deducing the behaviour of the authors. Given the complexity involved, we limit the analysis to scientists from countries that have the largest research output. Due to limitations in the available data sources, explained in the next section, we focus only on research in the fields of biology,2 but without restriction to the Covid-19 theme.

The paper is organised as follows: "Data and methods"Section presents the methodology and describes the data and methods used. In "Results" Section we show the results of the analysis. "Discussion and conclusions"Section concludes, discussing some policy implications and identifying further research developments.

## Data and methods

The use of traditional bibliographic repertories (such as Scopus, WoS, Google Scholar, Dimension or the like) would require a long time-window for observation of effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and its containment, considering the average time for an article to reach journal publication and subsequent delays of indexing in bibliographic repertoires. Instead, preprint repositories appear particularly appropriate to the current purposes of measuring on novel scientific knowledge produced at a short time from the Covid-19 outbreak.

Examining a number of preprint archives for suitability,3 it becomes apparent that relative to our objectives and methodology most of them are too small to assure robust elaborations. The sole exceptions are arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv. The arXiv archive, however, provides authors' affiliations for a very small share of preprints (around three percent), rendering it unsuitable for the country and international collaborations analyses, while the very recent launch of medRxiv negates extrapolation of trends in preprints posting.

Footnote 3: For a brief review of literature on the use of bioRxiv and preprint repositories in general as data sources, see Abramo, D’Angelo and Mele (2022).

bioRxiv is a free online archive and distribution service, primarily for unpublished preprints in life sciences research. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a not-for-profit research and educational institution,4 launched the service in 2013, subsequently receiving support from the Chan-Zuckerberg initiative (Callaway, 2017). bioRxiv provides free and unrestricted access to all preprints posted on the server, including for purposes of machine analysis of content. For the current research, we have used a wget script for retrieving all preprint metadata in XML format, with data extraction conducted on 16 June 2021. We retrieved all XML files related to the original deposition (version 1)5 of all preprints. We then implemented a parser in Python for extracting relevant information from each XML file. Specifically, we extracted: date of deposition, doi (record digital identifier in bioRxiv), author first names and last name, author position in the byline, affiliation name and country, and subject area.

The full set of processed XML files from bioRxiv is deposited each month, with delivery typically completed in the first days of the following month. From this, we can be confident that the dataset contains all depositions starting from November 2013 (the date of bioRxiv launch) up to 31 May 2021.

The full dataset retrieved from bioRxiv is made of:

* 128,767 preprints;
* 278,547 preprint-affiliation pairs (with an average of 2.2 affiliations per preprint);
* 953,828 preprint-author pairs (with an average of 7.4 authors per preprint);
* 1,262,045 preprint-author-affiliation triples (with an average of 1.3 affiliations per author).

In order to smooth monthly fluctuations, we applied a 12-month central moving average, which clearly causes the loose of 12 data points, related to 6 months at the top and 6 at the bottom of the time series. For this reasons, all the time plots shown in the following section end at November 2020. The bibliometric approach has been found especially effective in large scale observation of collaborations between scientists. In particular, by taking the unit of observation as the individual author of a preprint, and by analysing the affiliation list of that preprint, we are able to identify the work as the result of collaborations that are:

* _Intramural_, in the case where, for a given author, the analysis reveals the presence of one or more co-authors affiliated with the same organisation;
* _Extramural_ national, on discovering, for a given author, one or more co-authors from the same country but affiliated with national organisations other than their own;
* _International,_ on discovering, for a given author, at least one co-author affiliated with an organisation of a country other than their own.

A country profile emerges from all the authors of that country. We assign the country affiliation of each author at time of publication, therefore the affiliation may change along time. Single-authored papers are not included because they do not entail a collaboration.

The box below offers the example of a four-author publication.

For each of the four authors, the preprint is an international collaboration, given the presence of two distinct affiliation countries (USA and Japan). All authors, except the first, are also tagged with "intramural" collaboration: the second author has an affiliationtion the same as one of the third author; _idem_ for the fourth author. Finally, the tagging "extramural" applies to the first three authors, who show affiliations to distinct institutions (Colorado State University, University of Michigan) within the same country (USA).

The operational implementation of this classification implies the formidable task of recognising and unifying the bibliometric addresses for large scale global datasets, due to the lack of standardisation of the text strings indicating the affiliation of the preprint authors. This applies to all of the bibliographic repertoires, including in implementation with bioRxiv. In this case, the 128,767 downloaded preprints include 278,547 distinct addresses, referring to organisations in 187 different countries.

Given this, a decision was made to limit the analysis to a sub-section of the worldwide universe of research organisations, in particular to the universities of the top 14 countries of the Leiden ranking (LR), i.e. the largest countries in terms of worldwide scientific production.6 These are 858 universities, accounting for 73% of the total 1176 LR organisations. In Table 1, their breakdown by country shows China (221 universities) and the United States (200 universities) as most represented in number.

Footnote 6: Namely, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.

Through manual scrutiny of the 278,547 addresses of the dataset, all affiliations attributable to the 858 universities were then unified. Of the total preprints in bioRxiv, the 14 countries together account for 86.6% (111,528 out of 128,767), and the universities under observation account for 82.9% (92.454 out of 111.528) of the overall scientific production of those countries. The last two columns of Table 1 present the breakdown of the data referring to authorships, showing United States in the lead (327,393) followed by United Kingdom (110,974) and Germany (77,038). The share of national authorships traceable to LR universities varies from 16.9% in France to 76.0% in the United States. This wide variability is due both to the different weight of the universities within the national research infrastructure, and to the greater or lesser difficulty of the unification process of a country's addresses. In particular, for France there is a strong presence of "CNRS" addresses, which may ultimately refer to individual universities associated under this large organisation.

The data in the last row and last column of Table 1 show a dataset total of 497,013 authorships. About 3% refer to multiple records, i.e. to authors of preprints belonging to more than one LR institution. In the preprint cited above we have the example of Nabae, Hiroyuki, belonging simultaneously to the University of Michigan and the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

## Results

The following first provides a descriptive analysis aimed at answering the research questions of the study, namely the propensity to conduct collaborative research, the average number of co-authors per preprint and collaboration types, by continent and country. Subsequently we conduct an econometric analysis for verification of whether there is a discontinuity in the collaboration behaviour, as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic impacting on the organisation of scientific work.

### Descriptive analysis

The analysis previously conducted by Abramo, D'Angelo and Mele (2022) showed that the bioRxiv monthly depositions fit a non-linear growth trend up to the end of spring 2020, with a peak in June. After that, the authors register an abrupt inversion of the curve, indicating a disruptive effect of the pandemic on research production. Here, it may be useful to examine the data disaggregated by field. For this, Fig. 1 shows the plot of the 12-month moving average of bioRxiv depositions for the period 2016-2021, for the top ten scientific fields by number of deposition.

For all of them, we observe a reversal of the growth trend in the second half of 2020. In the major fields, the peaks are recorded in September (Neuroscience, Microbiology) and October (Immunology). The only anomalous curve is for Genetics, where the drop occurs in December 2019, i.e. prior to the onset of the pandemic. This was the month in which medRxiv and bioRxiv were integrated, which evidently led to a different classification of part of the genetics preprints within the field of biomedical research, from that moment onward.

Figure 1: Time series (12-months moving average) of bioRxiv preprint depositions, by scientific field

Figure 2: Time series (12-months moving average) of the share of solo-author bioRxiv preprint depositions

In order to check changes in the propensity to conduct collaborative research, Fig. 2 shows the percentage of preprint authored by one author only. The time plots very clearly show a decreasing trend, at least until September 2019. After that date, the trend seems to stabilise, although the average value for the 858 universities in the dataset seems to show a new negative slope also after August 2020. Interestingly, the time plot related to all bioRxiv preprints remains consistently above the one relative to the 858 universities in the dataset.

At the same time, the data trend for the average number of authors per preprint at aggregated level shows an increasing trend over the observed period, in particular, over the final three years (Fig. 3). From 2018 to 2020, the average number of co-authors of bioRxiv preprints increased by 9%. The final part of the series shows no particular discontinuity, from which we can deduce that the new Covid context did not impact on scientific research in terms of overall team size, at least at the aggregate level in the fields of Biology.

The comparison of the aggregate to the data on authorships of the 858 dataset universities, of the 14 "largest" LR nations, shows a very similar time sequence but with higher values of distribution throughout the series. Also, from 2018 onwards, comparing to the whole population, the average number of co-authors for the preprints produced by the data-set researchers is 7-8% higher. This could be related to the practice of limiting the Leiden ranking to those institutions above a certain size threshold in terms of publication numbers, assuming that such large institutions would have longer bylines than the excluded smaller institutions.

Disaggregating all bioRxiv preprints by continent, we obtain the curves of mean co-authors as shown in Fig. 4. These show a temporal sequence seeming to regularise only from 2018 onwards. Very evidently, Asian teams are larger than European and even more so than American ones. The comparison of Figs. 2 and 3, however, should not be misleading: the disaggregation of the data leads to the multiple counting of preprints authored by scholars from different areas (15.3% of the total), which presumably would also be characterised by higher numbers of co-authors. For this reason, the absolute values of the distributions in Fig. 4 are always higher than the corresponding ones in Fig. 3. In this regard, consider the case of a dataset consisting of only three preprints, the first one with a byline

Figure 3: Time series (12-months moving average) of the mean number of authors per preprint, in bioRxiv

of 10 European authors; the second 10 European and 10 American authors; the third with 10 European, 10 American and 10 Asian authors. At an overall level, the average number of authors per preprint would be 20, but disaggregated by continent, it would be: 20 for Europe, 25 for America and 30 for Asia. Heeding this caution and returning to observation of the curves, the increasing trend of the Fig. 3 time plot is not so evident in the three series of Fig. 4 except in the final parts, i.e. from mid-2019 onwards. Still, as for all bioRxiv, there is no appreciable discontinuity in the final part of the curves.

Turning to the analysis of the type of collaboration, Fig. 5 shows the time plot of the incidence of intramural collaborations on the total of the authorships. Unlike the analyses illustrated in the three previous figures, the unit of analysis in this case is the single author, so that the value on the ordinate of the plots represents the percentage of authorship of a given continent referred to preprints resulting from intramural collaboration.

Figure 4: Time series (12-months moving average) of the mean number of authors in bioRxiv preprint, per continent

Figure 5: Time series (12-months moving average) of intramural collaborations, by continent

The trend is upward for all three continents, with Asia showing the largest differential in growth from beginning to end of the observation period. Also notable is the trend of the North American curve: consistently above that of the other two regions, except for a few months in 2018.

The trends for the national extramural collaborations, by continent, are rather different (Fig. 6). For North America there is a negative trend, reversing only from April 2020. Europe also shows an early negative trend, but reversing about one year sooner. These sequences are not very evident, whereas for Asia there is a decidedly evident upward trend beginning from as early as the end of 2018, up to the final figure of 71.2% of national extramural authorship, compared to 63.9% recorded in September 2018.

Finally, as far as international collaborations are concerned (Fig. 7), the analysis reveals very different curves for the three continents: Europe having relatively stable values around

Figure 6: Time series (12-months moving average) of extramural national collaborations, by continent

Figure 7: Time series (12-months moving average) of international collaborations, by continent

65% of the total authorships,7 which is much higher than the levels of North America and Asia, in turn characterized by decreasing trends throughout the time interval.

Footnote 7: Note that, co-authorship by e.g. Italian and French researchers are considered as international collaborations, even though they are both part of the EC.

Figures 8-10 show results from the same analyses repeated at a more detailed level, for the four countries with the highest number of depositions (US, UK, Germany, China) and

Figure 8: Time series (12-months moving average) of intramural collaborations, by country

Figure 9: Time series (12-months moving average) of extramural collaborations, by country

for Italy and Japan. In this case, for reasons of significance, the plots show data for beginning 2017 to 2020.

With regard to intramural collaborations (Fig. 8), China, Germany, UK and USA show similar trends, with values in the range 75-90%. The trends also align, in pairs, towards the end of the period: China-US, Germany-UK, and Italy-Japan. In spite of these alignments, the USA and Germany show significantly increasing trends, also in contrast to UK and Japan, which seem to have negative trends from 2019 onwards.

National extramural collaborations are confined to the 55%-80% range and show a more erratic behaviour, particularly in the first part of the time interval (Fig. 9). Concentrating on the final part of the series, entering the Covid epidemic era, we see an increasing trend for almost all countries, including the USA, which until April 2020 showed a decreasing sequence. An exception is Japan, which from that date shows a plot that is substantially stable and much higher than all the other countries, at around 75%.

Finally, with regard to international collaborations, the plots in Fig. 10 show a segmentation in two groups: the three European countries (Italy, Germany, UK) with the highest values in the 60-80% range; China, Japan and USA in the 30-50% range. Within each group, the more dispersed initial trends (January 2017) tend to align over time, becoming partially overlapping especially in the COVID era. For international collaborations, contrary to intramural and extramural national, the lowest values are the prerogative of the United States: a country that leads in science and technology across the spectrum of fields and holds the largest research workforce, and therefore has less need to seek international collaborations in the search for skills and knowledge.

### Econometric analysis

The above analyses indicate that, by country, there have been temporal differentiations in the propensity of collaboration, although the impacts of Covid-19 on those propensities seem difficult to detect. In essence, the post-onset trends seem "aligned" with the pre-covid temporal sequences. However, investigating the phenomena further, we performed an

Figure 10: Time series (12-months moving average) of international collaborations, by country

economic analysis by means of a logit model, whose response variable is represented by a dummy, related case by case to the type of collaboration considered (intramural, extra-mural national, and international), for each authorship of the dataset preprints, attributable to the researchers of the 858 universities of the 14 "largest" LR countries. The target variable is represented by a temporal dummy (X1) with value 0 before the hypothesized Covid-19 temporal discontinuity and 1 afterwards, the discontinuity specified empirically by testing separate months straddling mid-2020. The testing of the pandemic impacting on the three collaboration types is by the significance of the relative coefficient. As explanatory variables we consider:

* The size of the researcher's university,8 expressed through two variables: the quartile for size distribution of universities in the country (X2) and the quartile for world distribution (X3, both variables 1 for the largest and 4 for smallest). The underlying hypothesis is that the probability of recourse to intramural collaborations depends on the size of the scientist's home institution. By means of the double specification we can distinguish between countries characterised by universities with a small average research staff, or by large average staff. In Italy, for example, only 7% of universities (3 of 42) are among the first quartile by size with reference to the 858 dataset institutions, in Spain an even lesser share (5%); contrarily, Switzerland has 7 of its 8, and Netherlands 9 of 13 universities in the first quartile by size, worldwide. Footnote 8: Data on the research staff of bio-related departments at universities in the 14 surveyed countries are not available. However they can be proxied through output data. Specifically, we used the number of preprints deposited by each university as a proxy of the size of its bio-related research staff.
* The number of co-authors of the preprint (X4), since obviously the probability of finding national and international extramural collaboration increases with the byline "length".

In addition to these variables, there are control variables related to the field of the pre-print and the author's country.

In method of estimating the logit model coefficients is by maximum likelihood procedure. Table 2 shows the estimates of coefficients in terms of odds ratios. In general,

Table 2: Logit Regression—adjusted for country and field the odds ratio indicates how much the odds of a particular outcome change for a 1-unit increase in the independent variable (for continuous independent variables) or versus a reference category (for categorical variables). Odds ratios greater than 1 correspond to "positive effects", given the increase in odds. Those between 0 and 1 correspond to "negative effects", because they decrease the odds. Odds ratios equal to 1 correspond to "no association". As seen from the data in Table 2, all the coefficients are statistically significant, except those for the dimensional variables in the modelling of international collaborations (last column of Table 2).

The odds ratio of the target variable X1 assumes highest value at time t = August 2020. The value is significant and greater than unity both for intramural (1.023) and national collaborations (1.041), indicating from August compared to previously, an increased incidence of these types of collaboration (2.3% and 4.1% respectively). In the regression model considering international collaboration as response variable, the OR of time dummy X1 is instead less than unity, at 0.921, indicating a significant reduction (\(-\) 7.9%) in the incidence of this type of collaboration, again from August 2020.

For the other factors, the coefficients of the dimensional variables (X2 and X3) are both significant and lower than 1, especially for intramural collaborations but also extra-mural national. Since the first quartile represents largest universities and the fourth the smallest, the results confirm what was initially hypothesised: probability of intramural collaboration decreases as the size of home institution decreases. Also, for national extramural collaborations, the ORs of the two-dimensional variables show values lower than unity, although higher than the homologues for intramural collaborations. For international collaborations, the effect of institutional size is not detectable: in the last column of Table 2, neither coefficient values for the dimensional variables is statistically significant.

Finally, the length of the byline of a preprint (X4) has a significant impact only on the international character of the co-authorship (OR equal to 1.081): the effect is significant

Table 3: Odds ratio for the target variable “time” by country, adjusted for field but practically negligible (1.001) on intramural character of collaboration and not at all significant for extramural.

The analysis just shown was repeated for each of the 14 largest LR countries. Table 3 shows the coefficient estimates (odds ratios) for the target variable X1 by country, adjusted for field effects. We can examine these coefficients by type of collaboration.

For intramural collaboration, the value of the X1 odds ratio is estimated greater than 1 (at t=August 2020) in 5 of 14 countries (Australia, China, Germany, Switzerland, USA), but statistically significant only for USA. In that country, for the 200 universities included in dataset, the advent of the pandemic seems to have been followed, at least in biology, by a significant increase in recourse to intramural collaboration. There are 9 countries with an opposite effect, indicating a sequence opposite to the USA, the most notable being for Japan and UK.

For extramural national collaborations the picture is patchy. Only three countries show significant effects on the target variable: Brazil and Germany, with ORs well above unity (1.126 and 1.179 respectively) and Spain, with the opposite effect (0.872). In 6 of 14 cases, the maximum likelihood estimation of the model failed to align.

Finally, in conjunction with the pandemic, the propensity for international collaboration seems to show a significant discontinuity in 9 of 14 countries. But while in the UK and India the effect is positive (OR equal to 1.215, 1.059), in the remaining 7 the OR is negative. The most evident variations concern Australia (\(-\) 17.4%), Switzerland (\(-\) 17.2%) and Spain (\(-\) 14.8%).

## Discussion and conclusions

Recently, many quantitative studies of science have concentrated on examining how the entire global science system reacted to the shock following the March 2020 declaration of pandemic status. The resulting literature has studied the changes in working environments, in particular the new ways of organising work, and the varying intensity of production and dissemination of new knowledge, with particular attention to the phenomenon of scientific collaborations. Not surprisingly, the interest in collaborations has focused almost exclusively on the fields of research directly pertaining to Covid-19.

In this paper, the authors conduct a global-level empirical analysis of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on research collaborations, but in all the fields of biology, i.e. including all the relative research themes. Among the different countries, the magnitude of slowdown in research activities has been determined by the pattern of infection spread, and by the extent of restrictions put in place by the relative governments. Our analysis evidences the global slowdown in the drastic drop in number of preprints deposited on bioRxiv, revealing this for practically all the fields covered. On the other hand, the time plot finds no appreciably significant change in the size of the research teams, and at first glance neither in research collaboration types, with the post-Covid types seemingly still dependent on processes already in place before the pandemic. The results of the multivariate econometric analysis, however, indicate a discontinuity in the propensity to collaborate, although differing according to the type of collaboration: a significant increase in the propensity to national collaboration (both intra- and extramural) seems to emerge, accompanied by a lower propensity to international collaboration. Such characterisations differentiate among countries, however, with some apparently increasing and some reducing recourse to the three different forms of scientific collaboration.

The picture emerging from the global-level analysis is therefore not entirely clear. Overall, research in the biology fields is clearly dominated by the larger countries, with the USA in the lead. In this country, for the 200 largest universities included in the dataset, the pandemic event has to some extent stimulated the relevant researchers to resort more to intramural collaborations, turning less to international collaboration. In other countries the evidence is opposite: in the UK, the second country for research production, use of international collaborations has instead increased while intramural collaboration declined. Specific national investigations should be conducted to validate the findings from this proposed analysis, and to develop understanding of the relative determinants.

As observed in the introduction, given the positive correlation between research collaboration, especially international, and productivity, it is to be expected that lower opportunities to collaborate due to restrictive mobility measures must have had a negative impact on research productivity. The lower productivity after the pandemic outbreak demonstrated by a number of studies, overall (Vincent-Lamarre et al., 2020; Korbel & Stegle, 2020), and in biology (Abramo, D'Angelo, & Mele, 2022; Redden, 2020) is to be attributed directly to COVID-19 infections, and pandemic-related limitations and impediments, and indirectly to reduced opportunities to work together in teams. Lower research productivity, all other equals, will translate into lower economic returns on R&D (Deleidi et al., 2019).

Generalizing the results to other disciplines requires extreme caution. One can expect that the lower propensity to collaborate due to containment measures must have hit wet lab scientists more than dry lab. In fact, for the latter, the presence at work and close interaction with colleagues is not as necessary (Korbel & Stegle, 2020).

The work embeds the intrinsic assumptions and limits common to most bibliometric-based studies. First of all, the circumstances that not all research collaborations lead to results encodable in scientific publications, and not all co-authored publications are the outcome of real research collaborations. Also, the bibliographic repertoies such as bioRxiv used here do not register all publications, while they may register preprints that will never be published.Beyond the typical limits of the bibliometric approach, this work presents limits specific to econometric analysis, concerning the weight of the omitted variables, highlighted in the regression models by the low values of the fitting statistics. Caution is a must, but certainly the subtlety of the approach (considering the individual researcher as the unit of observation) allows us to already affirm that at this level some truths emerge, apart from the in-depth studies and confirmations that would hopefully arrive from scholars of the subject, in the near future.
