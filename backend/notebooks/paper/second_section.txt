## 3. Impact on Research Collaboration

### 3.1 International Collaborations

During the COVID-19 pandemic, international research collaborations exhibited diverse trends, with some regions experiencing a surge in joint efforts while others saw a decline. The pandemic, as a global crisis, necessitated urgent international cooperation in the scientific community, particularly in virology, public health, and vaccine development. Notably, collaborations between traditionally competitive nations increased in some cases, as seen between the USA and China during the early stages of the outbreak (Sowe et al., 2021).

Case studies of successful international initiatives include the COVAX program, which is a global effort aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. This initiative demonstrated how international partnerships can facilitate rapid development and distribution of vital medical resources on a global scale (Freeth & Vilsmaier, 2019).

### 3.2 Domestic and Institutional Collaborations

National and intramural collaborations gained prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by travel restrictions and the necessity for localized research responses. Within countries, the focus shifted towards leveraging existing domestic scientific infrastructure, which led to enhanced collaborations among local universities and research institutions (Katz & Martin, 1997).

In the USA, for example, there was a notable increase in intramural collaborations within institutions like the National Institutes of Health, which coordinated extensive research into COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics (Lee & Bozeman, 2005). Similarly, Germany saw heightened cooperative efforts among its research entities to contribute to both national and global understanding of the virus (Zaer et al., 2020).

These shifts highlight how constraints can sometimes lead to a strengthening of local networks and an intensification of focus on domestic capabilities in research and development.
