## 2. Research Evolution in the COVID-19 Era

### 2.1 Changes in Research Focus

The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a notable shift in the thematic priorities of global research. A significant surge in studies related to virology, epidemiology, public health, and vaccine development has been observed (Sowe et al., 2021). This shift underscores the urgent need to address the immediate challenges posed by the pandemic.

Additionally, new interdisciplinary research fields have emerged, focusing on the intersections of COVID-19 with various sectors such as economics, education, mental health, and technology. Research into the economic impacts of the pandemic, the efficacy of remote learning, the psychological effects of lockdowns, and the development of advanced technologies for virus detection and contact tracing has become increasingly prevalent (Katz & Martin, 1997; Freeth & Vilsmaier, 2019).

### 2.2 Adaptations in Research Methodologies

The pandemic has enforced significant adjustments in experimental and field research methods. With the imposition of social distancing and restrictions on physical gatherings, researchers have had to innovate methods that accommodate these limitations. This includes the design of experiments that can be conducted remotely or with minimal human contact (Zaer et al., 2020).

There has also been an increased reliance on digital tools and remote collaboration technologies. The adoption of virtual laboratories, remote sensing technologies, and online collaboration platforms has accelerated, enabling researchers to conduct studies, share data, and collaborate effectively despite geographical barriers (Minasny et al., 2020; Rogers, 2020).
