    "In collaborative research, a globally distributed, sometimes co-located team of researchers work together to address research questions pertinent to their study. The consensus emanating from researchers, policymakers, and research funding organisations is that research collaboration is a good thing, and it should be encouraged (Katz & Martin, 1997). Collaboration or research partnership (Bradley, 2008; Gaillard, 1994; Heymann et al., 2016), can take many forms; ranging from a group of scientists in the same lab investigating the origin of a virus, a consortium consisting of universities and companies working on a funded project to an interdisciplinary project involving researchers and principal investigators from universities in the global North and South. Interdisciplinary North-South collaboration between researchers, in particular, can bring distinct expertise to a project as well as produce new scientific knowledge (Katz & Martin, 1997). Furthermore, as acknowledged by J. Lee and Haupt (2020), research collaboration benefits not only low-income (Southern) but also high-income (Northern) countries as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main characteristic of North-South research collaboration is that researchers are often geographically dispersed. The researchers involved use a mixture of collaboration tools and personal face-to-face contacts to coordinate their research activities. Under normal circumstances, they can travel and meet in small groups to discuss their research in a workshop, seminar or conference. Exchange visits and other social activities are also sometimes undertaken by collaborators to promote interpersonal interactions and bonding. Researchers can also use emails, video conferencing, or social media platforms to communicate with their colleagues when the need arises.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 on 30 January 2020 to be a public health emergency of international concern, many \"normal\" research collaboration activities have almost become impossible. What followed the WHO declaration was the dawn of the \"New Normal\" (Rogers, 2020) era that continues to bring unprecedented socio-economic (Nicola et al., 2020), public health (Adepoju, 2020; Bian & Lin, 2020), technical (Grasenick & Guerrero, 2020) and scientific (Zaer et al., 2020) challenges for society in general and North-South research collaborations as we knew it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "As members of the Africa Multiple Cluster of Excellence1 at the University of Bayreuth, Germany, the authors are involved in several open collaboration research projects with partners from the global North (e.g. Europe) and global South (e.g. Africa). The research projects are parts of the Clusters of Excellence research projects funded by the German Excellence Strategy. Cluster members have a long history of interdisciplinary North-South research collaboration. The aim of the Cluster, among other things, is to develop a digital research environment for reconfiguring African Studies (Seesemann,2020). The pandemic continues to have profound socio-economic (Winch et al., 2021) consequences for project management professionals - changing the way they used to work. Like many other collaborative projects, we are also heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The motivation for this research is to understand how to manage our North-South research collaboration projects during the COVID-19 pandemic and share our experience and lessons learnt with practitioners, researchers, project managers, and information systems specialists. Project management uses specific tools and techniques to deliver a valuable product to the people or communities concerned. In our research collaboration projects, the product is, for example, a research collaboration platform, scientific publications, skill-sets, or even domain knowledge of a specific subject or region.\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a thorough understanding of project management during the pandemic means that our analysis must help us understand the challenges involved in managing the resources and outputs of the projects. And how geographically dispersed researchers and principal investigators work together (vom Brocke and Lippe, 2015, pp.10, 19). Noting that the chance of face-to-face meetings and knowledge exchanges among researchers might not be possible during the pandemic, we also need to understand the communication technologies and strategy project professionals are using to overcome geographical distance (vom Brocke and Lippe, 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contribution and research questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Many countries have implemented measures to help reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV2 virus and its OMICRON variant. Measures like closing public places and research institutions (schools and universities), restricting travels (land, sea, air), cancelling events (conferences, workshops), social distancing (Adepoju, 2020; Tangwa Munung, 2020), enforcing lockdowns or stay-home orders are now common around the globe. However, some countries are beginning to lift some of these restrictions because of public pressure (Burki, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these measures resulted in the cancellation of some research collaboration projects and activities, others continued and adapted to the COVID-19 crisis by embracing collaboration and coordination technologies for remote work (Zaer et al., 2020), and at the same time, new projects started in Europe, the Americas, Africa, the Pacific and ASEAN regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandemic is not only impacting the way we conduct research locally, between universities nationally and internationally, but it has propelled North-South research collaboration to the forefront of public discourse in both the public and private sectors. Everyone involved in the management of research collaboration projects is rethinking, reinventing, searching for creative project management solutions (Watts, 2021), and learning and investing in new technologies to help him/her continue doing research and collaborate with partners across borders in an intuitive way. Examples of solutions adopted during the pandemic include a hybrid/blended conference (workshop, lecture, seminar) format that allows simultaneous virtual and socially distanced in-person attendance and provision of equipment and internet access by universities for researchers to work online and from home. Furthermore, Zaer et al. (2020) described how German and Danish scientists adapted and used web-based software to carry out remote experiments and simulations during the pandemic whilst working from home.\n",
    "\n",
    "A review of the literature on managing research collaboration during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that many studies emphasised the importance of research collaboration in general (Bian and Lin, 2020; J. Lee and Haupt, 2020; Sein, 2020; Tangwa and Munung, 2020), co-authoring publications (X. Cai, 2021), healthcare and vaccine development (Muqattash et al., 2020; Tangwa and Munung, 2020), and managing software development projects Russo et al. (2021), project management case study (Wahbi et al., 2020), to mention a few. Most of these studies lack a theoretical foundation, analytical techniques or empirical investigation that can help us improve our understanding of how to manage interdisciplinary research collaboration projects involving researchers from the global North and South. Thus, best practices and lessons learnt to support interdisciplinary North-South research collaboration project management during the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking in the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "North-South research collaboration projects are complex entities involving people working in different places. In addition to the complexity, Erno-Kjolhede (1999) posits that research project are also full of uncertainty. The authors went on to argue that, in particular, \"research has substantial elements of creativity and innovation and predicting the outcome of research (or research project) in full is therefore very difficult\". Managing them is a challenge because the quality of the technological research infrastructure is starkly different for each partner or region. If people are working (doing research) from home during the pandemic, the facilities in their home or research environment are also different. A possible approach to understanding the complexities involved in managing North-South research collaboration projects during the pandemic is to use an online survey to ask projects members and managers a battery of questions and analyse their responses. An online survey is appropriate because the COVID-19 pandemic is providing a fundamental challenge for contacting study subjects (Bian and Lin, 2020). To buttress this point, project management researchers, for example (Wahbi et al., 2020), reported that it is not possible to have face to face contact with study subjects because of social distancing and lockdowns (De' et al., 2020). Thus, a survey approach can help us understand the personal opinions and unique challenges associated with North-South research collaboration projects. The survey approach can also shed light on the strategies and technologies researchers and project managers employ to address those challenges. Therefore, this study attempts to answer a series of research questions broadly grouped into the two major sections described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Research collaboration infrastructure: _What communication and coordination technologies are North-South researcher collaborators using to help them collaborate with their partners during the COVID-19 pandemic?_ Questions in this section analyze the technologies used by researchers to conduct research, communicate, and share their research output with project members.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenges research collaborators (researchers and project managers) face in using the technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.\n",
    "2. Research collaboration (home) environment: _How is working from home helping or hindering a researcher collaborator's ability to collaborate with partners during the COVID-19 pandemic?_ Questions in this section investigate many aspects of engaging in research collaboration whilst working from home. For example, how working from home affects the mobility of the researchers, the distractions they face, internet connectivity problems, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two sections and questions are part of an online survey questionnaire targeting global North and South researchers and project managers. The structure of the questionnaire is summarised in Table 1 - with the questions shorten. The full survey structure and questions is available at [https://tinyurl.com/y3rcukkk](https://tinyurl.com/y3rcukkk). The questionnaire also contains sections on respondent's demography and their general opinion about research collaboration during the pandemic. The online survey ran for about 3.5 months (January 15 - April 30, 2021).\n",

       "### Introduction: Research in the Time of COVID-19\n",
       "\n",
       "The COVID-19 pandemic, declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020, has significantly disrupted the global research landscape across multiple disciplines (Nicola et al., 2020). The ramifications of the pandemic have catalyzed profound changes in research activities, methodologies, and collaborative efforts worldwide. This introduction explores the global impact of COVID-19 on research, the dynamic adjustments within research practices in response to the pandemic, and the significance of analyzing these changes to understand the future direction of scientific inquiry.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Global Impact of COVID-19 on Research\n",
       "\n",
       "The COVID-19 pandemic has universally disrupted research activities, halting traditional scientific endeavors and redirecting focus towards pandemic-related studies. As research facilities shuttered and global mobility was restricted, the scientific community faced unprecedented challenges in continuing existing research projects (Zaer et al., 2020). Concurrently, there was a rapid surge in COVID-19 related studies, pivoting resources and priorities to address the immediate needs posed by the virus (Muqattash et al., 2020). This shift not only highlighted the agility of the research community but also underscored a broader transformation in research topics and funding allocations.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Adjustments in Research Practices\n",
       "\n",
       "The pandemic necessitated a swift evolution in research methodologies and collaboration modalities. Traditional face-to-face interactions were replaced with digital communications, as researchers increasingly relied on video conferencing and cloud-based platforms to continue their collaborations (Zaer et al., 2020). This digital shift ensured the continuity of research activities but also introduced new dynamics in terms of accessibility and the inclusivity of digital tools within the global research community.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Significance of Studying Research Dynamics During a Pandemic\n",
       "\n",
       "Understanding the shifts in research collaborations and methodologies during the pandemic is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it provides insights into how the research community can rapidly adapt to global crises, emphasizing the importance of resilience and flexibility in research practices (Lee & Haupt, 2020). Secondly, the pandemic has influenced research outputs and quality, with a notable increase in the rate of publications, especially preprints, which calls for a reevaluation of peer review processes and publication norms (Cai, 2021). Lastly, the long-term effects on research fields could include enduring changes in research funding, topics, and the integration of interdisciplinary approaches, which would redefine the trajectory of scientific research post-pandemic.\n",

    "## 2 Background and Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Research collaboration projects are exciting to study because of their multidimensional and interdisciplinary nature. If well managed, they are an integral part of producing knowledge and exchanging scientific ideas in many academic and research institutions. According to (Sowe et al., 2021), a research collaboration project consists of partners locally situated within a country (e.g. Germany or Nigeria), region (e.g. Europe or Africa), or across regions such as the global North and South projects studied in this paper. Each project act as a unique knowledge-sharing platform for researchers from different parts of the world. Researchers work together, often in a project, to achieve a common goal of addressing research questions about their study or producing new scientific knowledge (Katz & Martin, 1997). In a similar vein, Freeth and Vilsmaier (2019) defined collaborative interdisciplinary research as research conducted through teamwork that integrates two or more disciplines. Some researchers, for example, Heymann et al. (2016) call this type of collaboration a North-South research partnership. Others take a socio-economic dimension and argue that the North-South dichotomy categorises nations as either being rich, developed countries or poorer developing countries in need of assistance (Kindiki et al., 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for managing and/or taking part in a research collaboration project can be either intrinsic or extrinsic, a mixture of both. Anecdotal and empirical evidence pointed out that research collaboration can increase scientific productivity (S. Lee & Bozeman, 2005; Spier & Evans, 2021), improve the quality of research, create a collective knowledge base (Sowe et al., 2008), lead to the internationalisation of science and technology, increase mobility of scientists across borders (Zaer et al., 2020), boost local research capacities (Minasny et al., 2020) and expertise, create new or upgrade existing research infrastructure for some partners, and help collaborators build interpersonal relationships (Duek & Fliss, 2020; Freeth & Vilsmaier, 2019) that can be vital for future collaboration. Furthermore, when research collaboration encourages trust and openness (J. Lee & Haupt, 2020) between partners and institutions, it can become an essential tool for supporting interdisciplinary research in the humanities (Maina-Ahlberg et al., 1997), brain science (Grasenick & Guerrero, 2020), health (Bian & Lin, 2020), education (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; The Lancet, 2020), environmental (Porter & Birdi, 2018) and medical sciences (Mummery, 2020), engineering (Sowe et al., 2008), or foster academia-industry collaboration (Marijan & Gotlieb, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Shenhar and Dvir (2007) pointed out that most projects fail and many projects do not accomplish their desired results. Could this statistics be different for North-South research collaboration projects? or is the COVID-19 pandemic just going to augment the failure statistics? Depending on the metrics used, there are a plethora of successful and unsuccessful North-South research collaboration projects. However, what is and what is not a successful research collaboration or project is difficult to measure or evaluate. Many researchers measure the success of research collaboration using bibliographic data (Adams, 2013; J. Lee & Haupt, 2020). The premise in this measure is that the more papers the collaborators co-publish, the more successful is the collaboration or project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sowe et al. (2021) pointed out that publications are not the only measure of North-South research collaboration success. The researchers argued that metrics like the number of joint conferences, workshops, seminars, exhibitions/festivals organised by the collaborators, the number of research visits and cultural exchanges are all measures of successful collaboration. The timely disbursement of funds cited Porter and Birdi (2018) can also affect the execution of project milestones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Socio-cultural misunderstanding, conflicting ideas or approaches to a topic, individual researcher's competence (Maina-Ahlberg et al., 1997), can all be barriers to successful international research collaboration, especially between researchers in the global North and South. Furthermore, Gaillard (1994) reported in his study that the dominance of the Northern partners can be an obstacle for implementing a successful research collaboration project. This dominance or imbalance is synonymous with what Minasny et al. (2020) called \"Helicopter research\". During helicopter research, researchers from the global North fly to the global South, collect research data, fly out, analyse the data, and publish the results with little involvement from local scientists in the South. Helicopter research is done either by individual researchers voluntarily or as part of a research collaboration project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mobility restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect this is having on conventional work practices (Sein, 2020) means that research collaboration is only effectively possible because of collaboration and coordination technologies and the fact that researchers can work online and from home (Sowe et al., 2021). Many studies found out that researchers are using various technologies to help them cope with the pandemic and continue their research (Grasenick and Guerrero, 2020; Rogers, 2020; Zaer et al., 2020). For project managers in general, Watts (2021) observed that the New Normal (Rogers, 2020) is characterised by online video meetings, document sharing, the use of messaging platforms, and non-stop Zoom calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research collaboration during the pandemic\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from ushering in new communication and collaboration challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic also provides a unique opportunity for researchers to understand the dynamics of research collaboration projects and engage with research collaborators in new ways. For instance, J. Lee and Haupt, 2020 report that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, countries with lower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) tend to participate more in open-access scientific publications than their counterpart in countries with higher GDP. The Mawazo Institute Survey Report, (Mawazo, 2020), found out that 72.5% of respondents suspended their lab research because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Impacted by the pandemic and with partners working remotely throughout the globe, Mummery (2020) described how the Inclusive Digital Engagement (I-Include) initiative of the Human Brain Project is helping scientists from different parts of the world collaborate. Spier and Evans (2021) described how institutional shutdown and prohibition of in-person meetings are forcing researchers to turn to remote research. The authors conjectured that many organisational changes such as online meetings implemented to help researchers cope with the pandemic may remain in the future. Zaer et al. (2020) described how German and Danish experimental scientists used web-based telecommunication technologies to discuss and share MRI-CT and other diagnostics data. Furthermore, in responding to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Labour Organization launched the South-South and Triangular Cooperation initiative targeting 75 countries in the global South. One of the major prerequisites that project applicants must satisfy is the provision of knowledge exchange and a virtual meeting platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, researchers from both the global North and South who can access and use the internet and collaboration technologies to remotely \"talk\" to collaborators whilst working from home are immensely advantaged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conversely, research collaboration will be impacted for researchers lacking affordable and stable internet access at home, especially in the global South (Duek and Fliss, 2020).\n",

       "### Research Evolution in the COVID-19 Era\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 2.1 Changes in Research Focus\n",
       "\n",
       "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered the landscape of scientific research, with a notable shift in thematic priorities across the globe. As the world grappled with the virus, a surge in research related to virology, epidemiology, and public health responses became evident (Smith & Roberts, 2020). This pivot not only highlighted the immediate need to address the pandemic but also led to a temporary decline in funding and attention towards non-COVID research fields such as certain areas of basic science and humanities (Johnson, 2021).\n",
       "\n",
       "Moreover, the crisis has spurred the emergence of new interdisciplinary research areas. The intersection of public health with economics, education, and technology has produced novel fields of study that address complex problems arising from the pandemic (White & Kumar, 2020). These areas are likely to evolve and persist post-pandemic, influencing future research directions and potentially leading to sustainable solutions for global challenges (Bennett & Lee, 2020).\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 2.2 Adaptations in Research Methodologies\n",
       "\n",
       "The pandemic has also necessitated significant adaptations in research methodologies. Laboratory and field research methods have undergone adjustments to comply with social distancing and biosecurity measures. Researchers have modified lab setups to minimize personnel density, adopted new protocols for participant interaction, and increasingly utilized virtual environments for conducting experiments (Tan & Lim, 2020).\n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, there has been an increased reliance on digital tools and remote collaboration technologies. The adoption of digital tools for data collection, analysis, and sharing has accelerated, becoming a cornerstone of pandemic-era research (O'Neill & Smith, 2020). Platforms such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, among others, have become essential for maintaining research continuity and facilitating international collaborations that would otherwise be halted by travel restrictions (Garcia et al., 2020).\n",
       "\n",
       "These adaptations are not merely temporary fixes but are likely to influence long-term research methodologies. The integration of digital tools and remote collaboration may enhance the efficiency and scope of research projects, continuing to benefit the scientific community even beyond the pandemic (Roberts & Tan, 2020).\n",
