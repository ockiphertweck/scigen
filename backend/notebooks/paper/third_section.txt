## 3. Impact on Research Collaboration

### 3.1 International Collaborations
During the COVID-19 pandemic, international research collaborations experienced significant shifts. While some countries decreased their international engagements, others, driven by the urgency to address the global crisis, enhanced their collaborative efforts (Nieto et al., 2020). For instance, despite existing geopolitical tensions, there was a noted increase in collaborative research between the USA and China during the early stages of the pandemic (Muqattash et al., 2020). Additionally, the United Kingdom and India saw a rise in their international research activities, likely fueled by the need for diverse expertise to combat the pandemic effectively.

Case studies such as the COVAX initiative, which aimed to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, exemplify successful international cooperation. This collaboration brought together scientists, governments, and international organizations, showcasing how global partnerships can facilitate rapid responses to worldwide health emergencies (World Health Organization, 2020).

### 3.2 Domestic and Institutional Collaborations
The pandemic also had a profound impact on domestic and institutional research collaborations. With travel restrictions and lockdowns in place, there was a notable pivot towards more localized research efforts. In countries like the USA and Germany, there was an increased reliance on intramural collaborations, utilizing the immediate institutional resources and networks available (Nieto et al., 2020). This shift not only highlights the adaptability of research institutions but also underscores the importance of robust internal capabilities.

Furthermore, the analysis indicated that larger institutions demonstrated a higher propensity for intramural collaborations, benefiting from their extensive internal resources and expertise (Muqattash et al., 2020). This internal realignment allowed for continued productivity in research outputs despite the external constraints imposed by the pandemic.
