### Introduction: Research in the Time of COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic, declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020, has significantly disrupted the global research landscape across multiple disciplines (Nicola et al., 2020). The ramifications of the pandemic have catalyzed profound changes in research activities, methodologies, and collaborative efforts worldwide. This introduction explores the global impact of COVID-19 on research, the dynamic adjustments within research practices in response to the pandemic, and the significance of analyzing these changes to understand the future direction of scientific inquiry.

#### Global Impact of COVID-19 on Research

The COVID-19 pandemic has universally disrupted research activities, halting traditional scientific endeavors and redirecting focus towards pandemic-related studies. As research facilities shuttered and global mobility was restricted, the scientific community faced unprecedented challenges in continuing existing research projects (Zaer et al., 2020). Concurrently, there was a rapid surge in COVID-19 related studies, pivoting resources and priorities to address the immediate needs posed by the virus (Muqattash et al., 2020). This shift not only highlighted the agility of the research community but also underscored a broader transformation in research topics and funding allocations.

#### Adjustments in Research Practices

The pandemic necessitated a swift evolution in research methodologies and collaboration modalities. Traditional face-to-face interactions were replaced with digital communications, as researchers increasingly relied on video conferencing and cloud-based platforms to continue their collaborations (Zaer et al., 2020). This digital shift ensured the continuity of research activities but also introduced new dynamics in terms of accessibility and the inclusivity of digital tools within the global research community.

#### Significance of Studying Research Dynamics During a Pandemic

Understanding the shifts in research collaborations and methodologies during the pandemic is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it provides insights into how the research community can rapidly adapt to global crises, emphasizing the importance of resilience and flexibility in research practices (Lee & Haupt, 2020). Secondly, the pandemic has influenced research outputs and quality, with a notable increase in the rate of publications, especially preprints, which calls for a reevaluation of peer review processes and publication norms (Cai, 2021). Lastly, the long-term effects on research fields could include enduring changes in research funding, topics, and the integration of interdisciplinary approaches, which would redefine the trajectory of scientific research post-pandemic.
