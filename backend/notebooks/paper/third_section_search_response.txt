## 3. Impact on Research Collaboration

### 3.1 International Collaborations
- Trends in international research collaborations during the COVID-19 pandemic indicated a variable impact, with some countries increasing and others decreasing their international collaborative efforts.
- The propensity for international collaborations generally decreased, with significant reductions noted in countries like Australia, Switzerland, and Spain, suggesting a shift towards more localized research efforts during the pandemic.
- Despite geopolitical tensions, some studies noted increased collaboration between major research players like the USA and China, especially in the initial months of the pandemic.
- Several countries displayed a realignment towards increased international collaboration, with the UK and India showing notable increases, potentially driven by the global urgency to address the pandemic.

### 3.2 Domestic and Institutional Collaborations
- National and intramural collaborations saw a general increase during the pandemic, suggesting a pivot towards more localized research networks, possibly influenced by travel restrictions and lockdown measures.
- The analysis revealed a higher inclination towards intramural (within institution) collaborations, particularly in countries like the USA and Germany, where researchers possibly relied more on immediate institutional resources and networks.
- Domestic collaborations showed mixed trends, with some countries like Brazil and Germany experiencing a significant rise, indicating a strengthened focus on national research capabilities.
- Institutional size played a role in the propensity for intramural collaborations; larger institutions tended to have a higher rate of internal collaborations, possibly due to wider internal resources and expertise available.
- The pandemic led to a noticeable shift in research dynamics, fostering more collaboration within countries and institutions, which could be a response to operational challenges and the pressing need for rapid research outputs in the face of COVID-19.
