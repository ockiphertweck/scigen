Many researchers focused on mailing lists to study coding activities of software developers. How expert software developers interact with each other and with non-developers in the use of community products have received little attention. This paper discusses the altruistic sharing of knowledge between knowledge providers and knowledge seekers in the Developer and User mailing lists of the Debian project. We analyze the posting and replying activities of the participants by counting the number of email messages they posted to the lists and the number of replies they made to questions others posted. We found out that participants interact and share their knowledge a lot, their positing activity is fairly highly correlated with their replying activity, the characteristics of posting and replying activities are different for different kinds of lists, and the knowledge sharing activity of self-organizing Free/Open Source communities could best be explained in terms of what we called \"Fractal Cubic Distribution\" rather than the power-law distribution mostly reported in the literature. The paper also proposes what could be researched in knowledge sharing activities in F/OSS projects mailing list and for what purpose. The research findings add to our understanding of knowledge sharing activities in F/OSS projects.\\\\n\\\\nOpen source software projects; Mailing lists; Knowledge seekers; Knowledge providers; Knowledge sharing; Open source communities; Power-law distribution; Self-organizing communities +\\\\nFootnote †: journal: Journal of Systems and Software xxx\\\\n\\\\n+\\\\nFootnote †: journal: Journal of Systems and Software xxx\\', metadata={\\'text\\': None, \\'title\\': \\'Sample2.

Therefore, scientists must be aware of requirements, restrictions and compatibility issues of Open Source licenses. We describe our strategy at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to awake the awareness among our domain scientists and to enable and support them in publishing Open Source software, which is free of license issues. We provide hands-on material, offer training courses, and foster knowledge sharing between peer scientists. Findings and feedback prove the usefulness and effectiveness.\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nK.5.1. [Legal Aspects of Computing]: Licensing; K.6.1. [Management of Computing and Information Systems]: Training\\\\n\\\\nopen source;licensing;collaboration\\\\n\\\\n## Introduction\\\\n\\\\nThe _German Aerospace Center (DLR)_ is a large governmental research organization with approximately 8000 employees at 20 sites. Between 2000 and 3000 persons are developing software in part of their work [5]. Most of them do not have any specific education in softwaredevelopment but only some programming skills. Especially, their knowledge about Open Source and adjacent topics is very limited.\\\\n\\\\nThe lack of knowledge about licensing [1] led to many issues because employees and management were confronted with making decisions anyway (e.g., choosing a proper license). Often, software was not published due to four of license violations or existing Open Source software was not used because of potential negative consequences.\\\\n\\\\nWe support domain scientists at DLR by enabling them to obtain the needed information themselves and make well-founded decisions with the following:\\\\n\\\\n* Information resources and training courses about Open Source licensing.\\\\n* Collaboration tools (Wkis) and dedicated workshops for knowledge sharing among peer scientists.\\\\n\\\\n## 5 Information Resources and Education\\\\n\\\\nA major reason among scientists at DLR for problems and issues in past was lack of knowledge about Open Source licensing. To overcome this situation, we provided a printed brochure and regular training courses about legal aspects of Open Source.\\\\n\\\\n### Open Source Brochure\\\\n\\\\nWe designed the DLR Open Source brochure as a reference book for all employees. An external law firm developed it in cooperation with DLR. The brochure was released in 2013 and distributed as printed copies and download-able PDF documents.\\\\n\\\\nThe brochure helps DLR employees to answer the most basic questions related to Open Source Software licenses. Specifically, it describes how to proceed when Open Source software should be distributed to third-parties. For the distribution of _unmodified_ and _modified_ Open Source Software, the brochure lists all obligations of the most important licenses that are used at DLR. The licenses are grouped into licenses with _strong copyright_, _weak copyright_, _without copyright_, and with _special rights_. For each license, the brochure has a simple checklist with all required obligations (e.g., how to prepare source code or which information to add to the distribution) as well as text boxes with explanations and additional information.\\\\n\\\\n### Trainings\\\\n\\\\nRegular trainings are part of the education program of DLR since 2012. The trainings take place in different DLR locations across Germany (see Table 1). Several additional customized trainings took place for specific teams.\\\\n\\\\nThe curriculum of the training consists of several topics about Open Source with focus on legal concepts and issues, such as copyright and liability, as well as Open Source licenses, including a detailed discussion of some widely used licenses.\\\\n\\\\nFor each training, participants can hand in their expectations and wishes for additional topics before the training and give detailed anonymous feedback after the training. Both on a voluntary basis by using paper questionnaires.\\\\n\\\\nThe questionnaire asks for prior knowledge about legal aspects of participants before the training. Half of the participants (50%) had some very limited knowledge, around a quarter has no knowledge, and another quarter has some knowledge based on previous experiences. The ratings after the training are mostly at least good on average. The results (Figure 1) shows that more than three-quarters of all participants rated the fulfillment of their expectations with either \"very good\" (34.8%) or \"good\" (43.6%). The participants also rated the expected benefits for their daily work. A third rated the expected benefit with \"very good\" (34.8%) and almost a half with \"good\" (43.5%). Wiki section, which also covers any other \"Open\" topic such as _Open Data, Open Standards, Open Access, or Open Science_. The DLR Open Wiki provides pages for topics, lots, literature, questions, and events as well as a separate section about how to get involved. Questions and their answers often are the basis for new pages on topics or tools. Since asking a question is a much lower hurdle to take than starting a page, this section became the entry point for many contributes. The Wiki offers a blog feature to announce new content in the Wiki and to share news (e.g., relevant Call for Papers or press releases).\\\\n\\\\n#### Knowledge Exchange Workshops\\\\n\\\\nSince 2013, so called _knowledge exchange workshops_ (german: _WissensAustaschWorkshops (WAW)_) are held at DLR. These workshops are interdisciplinary and aim on long-term exchange of knowledge on overlapping topics for the establishment and expansion of professional networks.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2014, the knowledge exchange workshop series for Software Engineering was started. In 2016, the focus of this workshop series was Open Source. In the same year the workshop series DLR Open started, which aims to cover all \"Open\" movements. The first workshop focused on Open Source and Open Standards.\\\\n\\\\nIn the knowledge exchange workshops, next to learning about Open Source topics, the exchange between DLR employees was encouraged. The peer-to-peer communication was emphasized to extend the informal networking among employees. In session with the whole plenum as well in small groups, the workshops produced many results and finding about the employees experiences, hopes, and fears.\\\\n\\\\nWe learned that Open Source software is already widely used at DLR. But mainly as more general tools and\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\begin{table}\\\\n\\\\\\\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\\\\\\\hline \\\\\\\\hline Year & Participants & DLR fine \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline\\\\n2012 & 32 & Open/Information \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2013 & 23 & Berlin \\\\\\\\& Coage \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2014 & 12 & Stanford \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2015 & 9 & Berlin \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2016 & 14 & Coage \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline \\\\\\\\hline \\\\\\\\end{tabular}\\\\n\\\\\\\\end{table}\\\\nTable 1: Numbers of Open Source training participants.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1: Ratings of Open Source trainings.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: Example page of the DLR Open Source Brochure.\\\\n\\\\nlibraries, which have been included into internal development processes and software projects. Research topic specific software was mainly developed in-house. On the other hand, exactly this specialized tools were seen as candidates to be published under an Open Source license.\\\\n\\\\nAs a major result of all workshops, the participants identified the lack of an official DLR process on how to publish Open Source software. One of the action items of the workshops therefore was to start the development of such a process.\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nWe presented some of our strategical efforts to support domain scientists at DLR in using and publishing Open Source Software. Focus of our activities is to provide usable material and support for immediate actions. We started with an Open Source brochure covering licensing, accompanied by training courses in the regular education program. After that we introduced collaboration platforms for knowledge sharing among peer scientists, such as Wiki pages and knowledge exchange workshops. Since we introduced our Open Source strategy, serious failures and issues with licensing have been reduced note-worthily. Feedback of domain scientist is good or very good. Based on that feedback we will extend our effort in the future, for example, by providing more technical infrastructure for code hosting or automated license checking.\\', metadata={\\'text\\': None, \\'title\\': \\'sharing_knwoledege_about.pdf\\'}), Document(page_content=\\'\\\\\\\\begin{table}\\\\n\\\\\\\\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\\\\\\\hline\\\\n**Data Source** & **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing** & **Researchers** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline CVS/SVN & Development process, Code evolution, Software quality, developer contribution & (DB05; MFH02; Gd04; BLR04) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline Bug Trackers \\\\\\\\& Change logs & Development process, Code and projects’ evolution, Who changed whose code, who commented on what & (GRS04; Ck04; Ca04) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline Mailing Lists/ Forums & Knowledge Sharing, Support, help, process, communities, interaction (developer-developer, developer-user, and user-user) & (SSA07; KSL03; LH03) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline F/OSS portals & Demographics, landscape, resource usage, Research and infrastructure. & (EST05; RB06; CH03; Xg05) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline Surveys, Field studies & Motivation for collaboration \\\\\\\\& knowledge sharing, developer \\\\\\\\& Users involvement, economics/concerns of distributed teams & (Rg02; PDS08; HNH03) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\hline \\\\\\\\end{tabular}\\\\n\\\\\\\\end{table}\\', metadata={\\'text\\': None, \\'title\\': \\'annals_of_knowledge_sharing_in_distributes_software.pdf\\'}), Document(page_content=\"## II Background\\\\n\\\\n### _Open source License_\\\\n\\\\nAn open source license is a type of license for computer software and other products that allows the source code, blueprint, or design to be used, modified and shared under defined terms and conditions [17, 18]. Open source licenses dictate the terms and conditions that come with the use of FOSS. Open source licenses serve as a legal agreement between open source author and user: authors make software available for free, but with specific requirements the user must follow [19]. In today\\'s mainstream open source licenses on the market, the stated terms relate to the software rights and interests mainly include _Commercial use, Distribution, Modification, Patent use, Private use_, and _Same license_, etc. Although the licenses in each category share common characteristics, the license terms give more details on what is allowed or not. In reference to the license description provid by _choosealicense_[20], the following information refers to the terms and condition.\\\\n\\\\n* Commercial use: The licensed material and derivatives may be used for commercial purposes.\\\\n* Distribution: The licensed material may be distributed.\\\\n* Modification: The licensed material may be modified.\\\\n* Patent use: (1) This license provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors. (2) This license explicitly states that it does NOT grant any rights in the patents of contributors.\\\\n* Private use: The licensed material may be used and modified in private.\\\\n* Same license: Modifications must be released under the same license when distributing the licensed material. In some cases a similar or related license may be used.\\\\n\\\\n### _Conflict of open source License_\\\\n\\\\nOpen source licenses vary according to their obligations on users and the permissions they grant. Based on these parameters, open source licenses are divided into two main types: permissive and copyleft. Copyleft licenses allow users to use, modify, and share works to maintain reciprocal obligations. Components with copyleft licenses also require users to make their code available to others [21]. On the other hand, the permissive license gives users the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute and allows proprietary derivative works with minimal obligations or restrictions imposed on the user [22]. Even though copyleft and permissive allow developers to use the software without paying the owner, there are specific differences in licensing authority. The main difference is the difference in the disposition of the code by the person using the open source code. GPL (2.0, 3.0), LGPL, AGPL, and other agreements are copyleft types of open source protocols [23]. On the other side, permissive licenses have much fewer restrictions. The developers can modify and use the code they desire, including _Commercial use_. Copyleft licenses prohibit proprietary software from using their code and explicitly require that all programs use the same licenses. In a combined program, the permissive and copyleft licenses are usually integrated, and the copyleft license is required for the combined program as a whole. However, some licenses do not fall into the two categories mentioned above. In this case, the compatibility must be determined based on the declared terms and conditions. As long as the terms and conditions in the licenses are compatible, combining two or more different open source components will not have conflict. Although the open source community encourages developers and organizations to reuse open source components, under the premises of avoiding legal risks while combining multiple licenses can still be a challenge.\\\\n\\\\n### _Conflict problem solution_\\\\n\\\\nIn recent years, some organizations have developed metrics to manage and measure the conflict in FOSS development. Among them, few studies on the compliance with intellectual property rights related to FOSS. As described by Zhang et al. [24], their compliance checking method provides an automated solution to help developers detect license conflicts. However, the scope of this tool on the market has lots of limitations. Possible casual discussions about intellectual property and FOSS were elaborated in the Open Business Readiness Evaluation Forum. One of the research and development areas of the Commercial Open Source Software Quality Platform project is to provide guidelines and tools to facilitate the intellectual property tracking process of FOSS and define a consistent license that complies with national laws and European regulations [25]. In addition, there are some representative tools. Black Duck software composition analysis allows users to discover and identify the open source components in proprietary software, their corresponding open source licenses, and vulnerabilities to help mitigate legal and security risks [26]. The FOSSology recommends analyzing all source code of a given project and intelligently reporting all licenses being used based on the license statement and descriptive phrases to help users identify the software license [27].\", metadata={\\'text\\': None, \\'title\\': \\'empirical_study_of_license_conflict.pdf\\'})]\\n\\nOnly output the generated Table of Content, no additional information.\\nThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\\n\\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}\\nthe object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

       "\n",
       "## Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### Background of Open Source Software\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Open Source Software (OSS) is a type of software that is released under an open source license. This license allows the source code, blueprint, or design of the software to be used, modified, and shared under defined terms and conditions. The open source license serves as a legal agreement between the author of the software and the user. The author makes the software available for free, but with specific requirements that the user must follow. These requirements often relate to the software's rights and interests, including commercial use, distribution, modification, patent use, private use, and the use of the same license. \n",
       "\n",
       "Open source licenses vary according to their obligations on users and the permissions they grant. They are divided into two main types: permissive and copyleft. Copyleft licenses allow users to use, modify, and share works while maintaining reciprocal obligations. Permissive licenses give users the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute the software, allowing proprietary derivative works with minimal obligations or restrictions imposed on the user. \n",
       "\n",
       "Despite the freedom and flexibility that open source software provides, it is important to note that there can be conflicts and challenges when combining multiple licenses. Therefore, it is crucial for developers and organizations to understand the terms and conditions of the licenses they are using to avoid legal risks.\n",
       "The concept of open source software (OSS) has its roots in the early days of computing, where software was often shared freely among academic institutions and research communities. This practice was largely due to the collaborative nature of scientific research, where advancements were made through the collective efforts of many individuals and organizations. However, as the commercial potential of software became apparent in the late 20th century, proprietary software models began to dominate the industry, restricting access to source code and limiting the ability to modify and distribute software.\n",
       "\n",
       "The modern open source movement began in earnest in the 1980s, in response to this shift towards proprietary software. Richard Stallman, a programmer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, launched the GNU Project in 1983 with the goal of creating a completely free and open operating system. This was followed by the establishment of the Free Software Foundation in 1985, which advocated for the 'four freedoms' of software: the freedom to run, study, redistribute, and modify software.\n",
       "\n",
       "The term 'open source' was coined in 1998 by Christine Peterson, a co-founder of the Foresight Institute, during a strategy session held in response to the release of the Netscape browser source code. The Open Source Initiative (OSI) was subsequently established to promote and protect this new approach to software development, and to provide a formal definition and criteria for open source licenses.\n",
       "\n",
       "Since then, the open source model has evolved and expanded, driven by the growth of the internet and the collaborative possibilities it offers. Today, open source software forms the backbone of the digital world, powering everything from web servers and operating systems to mobile apps and cloud computing platforms. The principles of open source have also influenced other areas, such as open access publishing and open data initiatives, reflecting a broader cultural shift towards openness and collaboration.\n",
       "The current state of open source software (OSS) is vibrant and dynamic, with a growing recognition of its value in the global software industry. OSS has become a fundamental part of various sectors, including education, government, health, and technology. It is now widely used in the development of operating systems, databases, web servers, and even artificial intelligence. \n",
       "\n",
       "  The OSS community has grown exponentially, with millions of developers contributing to open source projects worldwide. This has led to a significant increase in the number and diversity of OSS projects, ranging from small utility libraries to large-scale systems. \n",
       "\n",
       "  The rise of platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket has further facilitated the growth and collaboration in the OSS community. These platforms provide tools and infrastructure for version control, issue tracking, code review, and continuous integration, making it easier for individuals and teams to contribute to OSS projects.\n",
       "\n",
       "  In terms of licensing, there is a growing trend towards the use of permissive licenses, such as the MIT License and the Apache License 2.0. These licenses are favored by many developers due to their simplicity and flexibility, allowing for wide-scale adoption and use of the software.\n",
       "\n",
       "  Despite the progress, challenges remain in the OSS landscape. These include issues related to license compliance, code quality, security vulnerabilities, and sustainability of projects. There is also a need for more diversity and inclusion in the OSS community, as it is currently dominated by male developers from North America and Europe.\n",
       "\n",
       "  Looking ahead, the future of OSS is promising. With the ongoing digital transformation in various industries, the demand for OSS is expected to continue growing. Furthermore, emerging technologies like cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence are creating new opportunities for the application and development of OSS.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Importance of Knowledge Sharing in Open Source Projects\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Knowledge sharing plays a pivotal role in software development, particularly in the context of open source projects. Open source projects are characterized by a distributed, collaborative model of software development, often referred to as the 'Bazaar' model. This model blurs the traditional boundaries between developers and users, treating users as co-developers and fostering a high degree of collaboration and knowledge sharing. \n",
       "\n",
       "  In this model, knowledge sharing is not just beneficial, but essential for the success of the project. Developers and users share their knowledge and collaborate throughout the software development process, with the quality of this interaction being a key determinant of the project's success. This is because the 'talking to each other' facilitated by knowledge sharing is vital for cooperation, conflict resolution, and the establishment of trust among the software development teams.\n",
       "\n",
       "  The open source development process also facilitates the creation, diffusion, and transformation of software knowledge at an unprecedented rate. This allows both expert software developers and novice users to gain a deeper understanding of the software development process. However, the distributed nature of open source projects can present challenges to knowledge sharing, such as technological barriers, geographical distances, and the diverse needs and skills of project participants.\n",
       "\n",
       "  Despite these challenges, the availability of data in software repositories has made it easier to study collaboration and knowledge sharing in software development teams. This data can provide insights into who is involved in the project, who they are communicating with, what they are discussing, and the nature of collaboration in the software development process. \n",
       "\n",
       "  In conclusion, knowledge sharing is of paramount importance in open source software development. It facilitates collaboration, fosters trust, and contributes to the successful completion of the project. Therefore, understanding and promoting effective knowledge sharing practices should be a priority for all those involved in open source projects.\n",
       "Knowledge sharing in open source projects brings numerous benefits that enhance the overall productivity and success of these projects. Firstly, it promotes innovation and creativity. As developers and users share their knowledge, they expose each other to new ideas and perspectives, fostering an environment conducive to innovation. This can lead to the development of novel solutions and improvements to existing software.\n",
       "\n",
       "Secondly, knowledge sharing facilitates problem-solving. In the open source community, developers often encounter similar challenges. By sharing their knowledge, they can help each other find solutions more quickly and avoid repeating the same mistakes. This can significantly speed up the software development process and improve the quality of the final product.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thirdly, knowledge sharing contributes to the professional growth of individual project participants. By engaging in knowledge sharing, developers and users can learn from each other, acquire new skills, and deepen their understanding of the software development process. This can enhance their performance and increase their value as contributors to the project.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lastly, knowledge sharing can strengthen the sense of community in open source projects. It encourages collaboration, fosters mutual respect and trust, and helps build strong relationships among project participants. This can enhance team cohesion, improve morale, and increase the overall satisfaction of project participants.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, knowledge sharing is a powerful tool that can drive innovation, facilitate problem-solving, promote professional growth, and strengthen community in open source projects. Therefore, it should be actively encouraged and facilitated in these environments.\n",
       "While knowledge sharing is crucial for the success of open source projects, it is not without its challenges. The distributed nature of open source projects often means that participants are spread across different geographical locations, which can make real-time communication and collaboration difficult. This geographical dispersion can also lead to cultural differences and language barriers, which can further complicate knowledge sharing.\n",
       "\n",
       "  Technological barriers can also pose challenges to knowledge sharing in open source projects. Not all participants may have access to the same tools or platforms, which can hinder their ability to contribute to the project. Additionally, the use of different software or systems can lead to compatibility issues, making it difficult for participants to share and integrate their work.\n",
       "\n",
       "  The diverse needs and skills of project participants can also present challenges to knowledge sharing. In open source projects, participants often have different levels of expertise and familiarity with the project. This diversity can make it difficult to ensure that everyone has a common understanding of the project and its goals. It can also make it challenging to create documentation or other resources that are accessible and useful to all participants.\n",
       "\n",
       "  Despite these challenges, the benefits of knowledge sharing in open source projects far outweigh the difficulties. By fostering a culture of openness and collaboration, and by implementing strategies to overcome these challenges, open source projects can harness the collective knowledge and skills of their participants to drive innovation and success.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Knowledge Sharing Activities in Open Source Projects\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### Communication Channels\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Communication channels such as mailing lists and forums play a crucial role in knowledge sharing activities in Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) projects. These platforms facilitate the exchange of information and expertise among software developers and users. \n",
       "\n",
       "Mailing lists, in particular, have been a subject of several studies. For instance, research has shown that only a small number of core and active developers engage in code development discussions on these platforms. Some mailing lists, like those in the Apache project, generate minimal discussion. This raises questions about the nature of knowledge sharing and the implications when active knowledge providers cease participation. \n",
       "\n",
       "Forums, on the other hand, have been used to study how information seekers post their questions and how potential information providers read and post answers. A study on the Apache 'field support system' revealed that about 2% of the knowledge providers were responsible for about 50% of the answers to questions posted on the help system. \n",
       "\n",
       "However, there is a lack of methodology to identify who is posting and who is replying in these communication channels. This gap in research motivates further exploration into the knowledge sharing activities of F/OSS projects' mailing lists. \n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, mailing lists and forums serve as vital communication channels in F/OSS projects, facilitating knowledge sharing among developers and users. However, more research is needed to understand the dynamics of these platforms and their impact on the productivity and knowledge sharing activities of the participants.\n",
       "Project documentation plays a pivotal role in the knowledge sharing process within Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) projects. It serves as a repository of accumulated knowledge, providing a comprehensive overview of the project's development history, design decisions, and technical specifications. This documentation, often accessible to all project participants, facilitates the transfer of knowledge among developers and users, supplementing the discussions that occur in mailing lists and forums. \n",
       "\n",
       "  Project documentation can include a variety of materials, such as design documents, user manuals, API references, and even inline code comments. These resources provide valuable context and insight, helping developers understand the project's codebase and users navigate the software's features. \n",
       "\n",
       "  However, the effectiveness of project documentation as a communication channel largely depends on its quality and upkeep. Outdated or poorly written documentation can hinder rather than help knowledge sharing. Therefore, maintaining high-quality documentation is crucial for the smooth functioning of F/OSS projects. \n",
       "\n",
       "  Furthermore, project documentation can also serve as a learning resource for new project participants, helping them get up to speed with the project's development practices and codebase. This can mitigate the impact of developer turnover, ensuring that knowledge is not lost when active developers cease participation. \n",
       "\n",
       "  Despite its importance, the role of project documentation in F/OSS projects is often overlooked in research. Future studies could explore how the quality of project documentation impacts the productivity and knowledge sharing activities of project participants.\n",
       "Code comments and commit messages are integral components of communication channels in Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) projects. They serve as critical tools for knowledge sharing among developers and users, providing insights into the rationale behind specific code changes and design decisions. \n",
       "\n",
       "Code comments, embedded directly within the source code, offer context-specific explanations and clarifications. They can elucidate complex code segments, specify the purpose of functions or variables, and provide instructions for future modifications. This makes the codebase more understandable and maintainable, especially for new or less experienced developers. \n",
       "\n",
       "Commit messages, on the other hand, accompany each code change or 'commit' made to the project's repository. They summarize the modifications made, explaining why they were necessary and how they affect the overall project. These messages serve as a running log of the project's development history, enabling developers to track changes over time and understand the evolution of the codebase. \n",
       "\n",
       "Both code comments and commit messages contribute to the collective knowledge base of the project. They facilitate the transfer of tacit knowledge, turning individual insights into shared understanding. This is particularly important in F/OSS projects, where developers often work asynchronously and remotely. \n",
       "\n",
       "However, the effectiveness of code comments and commit messages as communication channels depends on their quality. Clear, concise, and meaningful comments and messages can significantly enhance knowledge sharing. Conversely, vague or misleading comments and messages can cause confusion and hinder the development process. \n",
       "\n",
       "Despite their importance, code comments and commit messages are often overlooked in research on F/OSS projects. Future studies could explore how the quality of these communication tools impacts the productivity and knowledge sharing activities of project participants. Such research could provide valuable insights for improving communication practices in F/OSS projects.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Knowledge Providers and Seekers\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Knowledge providers in the context of Open Source Software (OSS) communities are typically the contributors who are skilled and experienced in a specific module of the project. These individuals are often the original owners of the files or systems in the project and are responsible for performing maintenance tasks. They are considered the most knowledgeable ones on the project, making major code contributions and sharing their knowledge through technology-mediated channels such as mailing lists, forums, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC). \n",
       "\n",
       "The knowledge providers play a crucial role in the hierarchical onion-like structure of OSS projects, where they are typically situated at the core. They contribute to about 80% of the code in OSS projects, indicating a non-uniform distribution of knowledge with a higher concentration of code contributors in the center of the onion than in the outer layers. \n",
       "\n",
       "However, the transient nature of the OSS workforce often results in turnover-induced knowledge loss. This is because these knowledge providers may not explicitly share their acquired knowledge upon leaving, leading to a knowledge gap in the project. Unlike employees in traditional software development organizations, these contributors may not be under any contractual obligation to notify their departure or to fulfill a notice period during which knowledge transfer concerns can be addressed. \n",
       "\n",
       "Therefore, the characteristics of knowledge providers in OSS communities underscore the importance of proactive knowledge retention practices. These practices aim to transform the use of knowledge and engagement in knowledge-relevant activities, including knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer, to mitigate the impact of knowledge loss.\n",
       "Knowledge seekers in the context of Open Source Software (OSS) communities are typically the users or contributors who are in need of specific information or expertise related to the project. These individuals may be new to the project, or they may be experienced contributors who are venturing into unfamiliar areas of the project. They rely on the knowledge providers for guidance and support, often seeking assistance through technology-mediated channels such as mailing lists, forums, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC). \n",
       "\n",
       "Knowledge seekers play a crucial role in the OSS communities as they drive the knowledge sharing process. Their inquiries often lead to the generation of new knowledge as they prompt discussions, debates, and problem-solving efforts. They contribute to the dynamism and continuous learning within the OSS communities.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, the transient nature of the OSS workforce also affects the knowledge seekers. As knowledge providers leave, knowledge seekers may find it increasingly difficult to find the information or expertise they need. This underscores the importance of proactive knowledge retention practices, which aim to ensure that knowledge remains accessible even in the face of contributor turnover.\n",
       "\n",
       "Characteristics of knowledge seekers in OSS communities include a willingness to learn, the ability to formulate clear and specific inquiries, and the capacity to apply acquired knowledge to their tasks. They may also demonstrate persistence in seeking knowledge, often following up on their inquiries or seeking multiple sources of information until they find what they need. These characteristics enable them to navigate the complexities of OSS projects and to contribute effectively to their success.\n",
       "The interaction between knowledge providers and seekers in Open Source Software (OSS) communities is a dynamic and complex process, often mediated by technology. This interaction is crucial for the transfer and creation of knowledge within the community. Knowledge providers, being the more experienced contributors, share their expertise and insights through various channels such as mailing lists, forums, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC). They respond to inquiries, participate in discussions, and provide guidance to knowledge seekers.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, knowledge seekers, who may be new or less experienced contributors, actively seek out information and expertise from knowledge providers. They pose questions, initiate discussions, and apply the knowledge they acquire to their tasks. This interaction often leads to the generation of new knowledge, as it prompts discussions and problem-solving efforts that may not have occurred otherwise.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, this interaction is not without its challenges. The transient nature of the OSS workforce means that knowledge providers may leave the community, leading to a potential knowledge gap. Knowledge seekers may find it increasingly difficult to find the information or expertise they need. This underscores the importance of proactive knowledge retention practices, which aim to ensure that knowledge remains accessible even in the face of contributor turnover.\n",
       "\n",
       "Moreover, the interaction between knowledge providers and seekers is not a one-way process. Knowledge seekers also contribute to the knowledge base of the community by sharing their own insights and experiences. They may also challenge existing knowledge, prompting re-evaluation and refinement of ideas. This reciprocal nature of the interaction between knowledge providers and seekers is a key characteristic of the knowledge sharing process in OSS communities.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, the interaction between knowledge providers and seekers in OSS communities is a vital process that drives knowledge sharing and creation. Despite the challenges posed by the transient nature of the OSS workforce, this interaction contributes to the dynamism and continuous learning within the OSS communities.\n",

       "## Case Study: The Debian Project\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### Overview of the Debian Project\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The Debian Project, a free software community, was officially founded by Ian Murdock on August 16, 1993. The name 'Debian' was formed as a portmanteau of the first name of Murdock's then-girlfriend, Debra Lynn, and his own first name. The Debian Project's key goals include producing a free and open-source computer operating system, Debian GNU/Linux, that is stable, reliable, and rich with utilities and applications. \n",
       "\n",
       "The Debian Project is also committed to free software principles, and its social contract sets out its responsibilities to the free software community. The Debian Free Software Guidelines, which form part of the social contract, have been used as the basis for the Open Source Definition. \n",
       "\n",
       "The Debian Project is structured as a do-ocracy, where individuals choose what to work on and decisions are made through consensus. This structure is supported by a constitution and a set of policy documents. The project is known for its strong adherence to software quality and ethical standards, including the use of open standards and formats, and the freedom to use, modify, and distribute software.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Debian Project has had a significant influence on the world of free software. Its rigorous release standards, high-quality package management, and commitment to free software principles have set the bar for other distributions. The project's practices, such as its use of open bug tracking systems and mailing lists, have also been influential. \n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the Debian Project's history and goals reflect its commitment to creating a free and open-source operating system, its adherence to free software principles, and its influence on the broader free software community.\n",
       "The Debian community is structured as a do-ocracy, where individuals choose what to work on and decisions are made through consensus. This structure is supported by a constitution and a set of policy documents. The community is characterized by hierarchical structures and clear labor division. Individuals within the community tend to adopt specialized and unassigned roles, as either knowledge seekers or knowledge providers or both, determined by the types of emails exchanged. When ranking the individuals according to their postings or replies, a hierarchical structure emerges in which some individuals dominate posting and replying activities. However, the dominant role of an individual is not always stable. The community also has 'star contributors' who contribute most of the posts and replies. Dominant repliers tend to be long-term members of the community, assumed to be well experienced and know the software well. On the contrary, dominant posters are expected to be 'young' in the community, less experienced, and ask a lot of questions. The distribution of the posts and replies in the community follows a power-law distribution, suggesting a complex and interesting dynamic in knowledge sharing within the Debian community.\n",
       "The Debian Project is characterized by several key features that contribute to its success and influence in the free software community.

       "The Debian project, a free software community, heavily relies on mailing lists as a primary means of communication and knowledge sharing. Mailing lists serve as platforms where both developers and users can post questions, share solutions, and discuss various topics related to the project. \n",
       "\n",
       "In the Debian project, there are two main types of mailing lists: Developer and User. The Developer list is primarily used by the development community, where participants tend to contribute more replies than posts. This is likely because postings in the developer lists often contain sufficient information for other participants to analyze the request. These posts are given high priority as they are likely to come from members of the development community, thus receiving the attention of almost all participants.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, the User list is more active in terms of posting. Participants in this list post more than they reply to questions. This could be because not all posts in the User list may be of interest to all participants, unless they follow the advice on 'How To Ask Questions The Smart Way'.\n",
       "\n",
       "The activities on both lists are correlated. When posting increases, replying also increases. However, this correlation is stronger for the User list. This suggests that more questions in the User list generate more answers.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Debian project's mailing lists are characterized by a self-organizing structure. Individuals tend to adopt specialized roles, either as knowledge seekers or providers, determined by the types of emails they exchange.

       "### Summary of Findings\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The study of knowledge sharing in open source projects reveals several key insights. Firstly, the Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) projects present unique opportunities for understanding collaboration and knowledge sharing among software developers and users in distributed software development environments. The Bazaar model, which treats software users as co-developers, has fundamentally changed the way software projects are initiated, developed, distributed, and maintained. This model blurs the developer-user communication gap and facilitates collaboration between all individuals involved in software development, use, and support. \n",
       "\n",
       "Secondly, the success of any F/OSS project highly depends on the quality of interaction between all participating agents. This kind of 'talking to each other' is vital for the cooperation and resolution of any conflicts which may arise and the establishment of trust among software development teams. \n",
       "\n",
       "Thirdly, the F/OSS development process facilitates the creation, diffusion, and transformation of software knowledge at an unprecedented rate. However, the process is challenged by technological barriers for some users, geographical distances, and the varying needs, knowledge, and skills of participants in the software development process. \n",
       "\n",
       "Lastly, empirical studies addressing collaboration and knowledge sharing in software development teams are made easy by the availability of data in software repositories. Researchers can now understand who is involved, who is talking to whom, what is talked about, and the nature of collaboration in the software development process. Despite the challenges, the insights gained from these studies provide a platform to discuss and share current understandings and challenges facing empirical research aimed at understanding knowledge sharing in open source projects.\n",
       "The case study findings provide a comprehensive understanding of knowledge sharing in open source software projects. The study design was meticulously crafted to address the challenges posed by turnovers during a project, with a focus on understanding the knowledge possessed by individuals within a team. The ConceptRealm representation was introduced as a tool to provide invaluable insights to managers. The study aimed to investigate the predictive ability of these concepts and monitor their change during the course of project evolution. The research questions were designed to validate the extracted concepts, measure their change over time, assess their ability to measure the effect of a leaving developer on team knowledge, and evaluate the effectiveness of ConceptRealm in detecting concepts and identifying the impact of leaving developers. The study utilized a mixed-method approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research techniques to provide a well-rounded understanding of the problem. The research design included experimental designs, surveys, case studies, and phenomenological research. The case study also demonstrated the application of Graphmania to F/OSS projects data collected from SourceForge, highlighting its effectiveness in visualizing the relationship among developers and projects.\n",
