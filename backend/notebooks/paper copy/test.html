    <h2>Theoretical Foundation</h2>
    
    <p>
      This section provides the theoretical background necessary to understand
      the dynamics of knowledge sharing in F/OSS projects. It introduces the
      Knowledge Sharing Model (KSM) and explains the processes of
      externalization and internalization of knowledge within mailing lists.
